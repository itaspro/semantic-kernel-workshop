Driver’s Handbook | 5INTRODUCTIONSharing the road means that all users have to exercise courtesy and mutual respect. Whether we are pedestrians, cyclists, passengers or drivers, we need to be informed about standards for using the road network and our duty to comply with those standards.Generally speaking, all road users must be careful and considerate when travelling on a public highway, especially toward more vulne-rable users. Vulnerable users, for their part, have a duty to adopt behaviours that enhance their own safety.Although this publication does not cover everything, the Driver’s Handbook summarizes all the main rules of the Highway Safety Code and its regulations. It is one of the main reference tools for all road users, in particular new drivers. The six chapters cover people’s obligations and rules about vehicles, road signs and traffic signals, as well as penalties resulting from offences under the regulations.This edition includes regulatory amendments applied over recent years, including graduated licensing for all new drivers who are required to take a driving course, 4-, 8- and 12-demerit point brackets for drivers under 25 and the consequences of impaired driving. We also deal with some other unauthorized practices, like street racing and car surfing, as well as the various behaviours to adopt near emergency vehicles or road construction workers.The Web site of the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (saaq.gouv.qc.ca) has a great deal of additional information on a number of subjects related to road safety and its requirements. For any legal references, please refer to the Highway Safety Code and atten-dant regulations.We hope that this publication will help users of the road network be better informed of the importance of adopting safe, cooperative and responsible behaviours.

appropriate to the vehicle driven. Depending on which provisions of the Highway Safety Code apply to your situation, the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) will issue you a learner’s licence, a probationary licence, a regular driver’s licence or a restricted licence.Over 5,100,000 Quebecers hold a driver’s licence. Obtaining a  driver’s licence is not an automatic right. Getting and keeping a licence depends on meeting requirements and specific conditions. Your licence can be taken away if your behaviour or health condition has become a threat to your own safety and that of other road users.As a driver, you need to take your state of health into consideration and adopt cooperative, safe and responsible behaviour, and be aware of how this could influence your driving. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 15LICENCES TO DRIVETo obtain a first driver’s licenceA first driver’s licence is  generally issued for the operation of a  passenger vehicle (Class 5 licence). You may qualify for a driver’s licence after holding a learner’s licence, and then a probation-ary licence.Basic requirementsTo obtain the class of driver’s licence for a passenger vehicle, you must be at least age 16. The written consent of a person with parental authority is required if you are under age 18.You also have to present two pieces of identification. The first must be from the Directeur de l’état civil du Québec or a civil authority recognized elsewhere in Canada, a certificate of Canadian citizenship, a legal document indicating Canadian citizenship or a Permanent Resident Card or a Canadian passport. The second piece of identifi-cation can be a provincial health insurance card. Chapter 1The driver16 | Driver’s HandbookSteps to obtain a Class 5 driver’s licenceRegistering for the driving courseTo drive a passenger vehicle, first you have to register for the manda-tory driving course. The Road Safety Education Program provides new drivers with the skills required to adopt safe, cooperative and responsible behaviour. The course is divided into four different learning phases that alternate with theoretical modules and in-car driving sessions. The emphasis is on visual scanning, anticipation of risks, dangerous behaviour (speeding, drinking, using drugs, distrac-tion) and sharing the road.The mandatory driving course is offered by driving schools recognized by the Association québécoise des transports (AQTr). For information about the schools, contact the AQTr or visit its Web site:Association québécoise des transports 6666, rue Saint-Urbain Bureau 450 Montreal (Québec) H2S 3H1 Telephone: 514 523-6444  aqtr.comFOR A NEW GENERATION OF DRIVERS Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 17Getting a learner’s licenceAt the end of Phase 1 of the Road Safety Education Program, you are required to take a knowledge test.Once you have received an  attes-tation from the driving school confirming that you have passed Phase 1, you can apply for your learner’s licence in an SAAQ service centre, if you meet the follow-ing requirements: ▶Prove your identity by submitting the identification previously indicated in the “Basic requirements” section; ▶Fill out the SAAQ’s Declaration of Illness or Impairment form and meet the medical requirements; ▶Pass the SAAQ’s vision test; ▶Provide the duly completed attestation from the driving school.You must hold a learner’s licence for at least 12 months, during which time you are subject to specific rules, including the following: ▶You must be accompanied at all times by an authorized person in the front passenger seat who is able to provide you with assistance and advice; ▶Prohibition from driving:  ▷Between midnight and 5 a.m.; ▷After consuming alcohol or drugs; ▶If you accumulate four or more demerit points in your driving record, your licence will be revoked and you must wait three months before you are eligible to obtain a new one.  Chapter 1The driver18 | Driver’s HandbookPractising drivingIf you hold a learner’s licence, you are authorized to drive on the road network accompanied by a driving instructor during the  driving course. Outside of class time, you have to be accompanied by a person who has held a valid driver’s licence for a passenger vehicle for at least two years.The accompanying rider must be seated next to you and be prepared to provide you with assistance and advice. Remember that a probation-ary licence holder cannot act as an accompanying rider for a learner.Passing the knowledge testDuring the mandatory training course, you have to pass the knowl-edge test in an SAAQ service centre. To be eligible for the test, you have to have held a learner’s licence for at least 10 months and have made an appointment.The purpose of this test is to check if you can apply your knowledge about regulations, road signs and traffic signals, and behaviour to adopt in various situations. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 19If you fail the test, you have to wait at least 28 days before taking the knowledge test again. If you pass the test, you are still required to take all of the theoretical modules and do all of the in-car sessions of the driving course.Passing the road testAfter passing all of the phases of the mandatory driving course, you have to pass the road test in an SAAQ service centre. To be eligible for the test, you need to make an appointment and: ▶Have passed the knowledge test; ▶Have held a learner’s licence for at least 12 months; ▶Have a driving course attestation, duly completed,  confirming that you have passed all of the learning phases at a driving school recognized by the Association québécoise des transports.During the road test, the SAAQ examiner checks whether you put into practice your knowledge of the Highway Safety Code, road signs and traffic signals, and behaviour to adopt on the road, as well as whether you have the skills to drive safely, cooperatively and responsibly.If you fail the test, you have to wait at least 28 days before taking the test again.Getting a probationary licenceOnce you pass the road test, you can obtain a probationary licence at an SAAQ service centre. You need to hold a valid proba-tionary licence for 24 months before you can obtain a regular  driver’s licence. Chapter 1The driver20 | Driver’s HandbookA probationary licence is subject to the following specific rules: ▶Your 24 months of experience with this licence can be  accumulated only while it is valid; ▶Your licence will be revoked and suspended for at least three months if you accumulate four or more demerit points in your driving record; ▶You are prohibited from driving after consuming any alcohol or drugs. It is zero tolerance! You must not have any traces of alcohol or drugs in your system;  ▶You cannot act as an accompanying rider for a learner driver of a road vehicle.Carrying passengersProbationary licence holders aged 19 or under may only carry a limited number of passengers who are also aged 19 or under between midnight and 5 a.m. ▶Drivers with 6 months or less of driving experience can carry only one passenger; ▶Drivers with between 6 and 12 months of driving experience can carry up to 3 passengers. The driver’s immediate family members, however, are excluded from the passenger count, including: ▶The driver’s spouse (married, civil union or de facto spouse); ▶The driver’s or the spouse’s children; ▶The driver’s brothers and sisters; ▶Children of the driver’s mother or father or of their spouses.These restrictions do not apply if: ▶The driver has over 12 months of driving experience;  ▶An accompanying passenger who has held a driver’s licence for two or more years is seated in the front passenger seat and is able to provide the driver with assistance and advice.  Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 21Driver’s licenceAfter acquiring 24 months of  driving experience with a  probationary licence, you can go to an SAAQ service outlet to obtain your driver’s licence.Specific demerit point brackets now apply to driver’s licence holders under 25 years of age, meaning that the limit of demerit points allowed on their record is lower. Thus, their licences are revoked sooner if they commit offences that result in demerit points being entered in their record. The period during which they cannot obtain a new licence after it has been revoked can also be longer.Demerit point bracket by type of licence ▶Learner’s licence and probationary licence ......................4 points ▶Driver’s licence holder - under 23 .................................... 8 points ▶Driver’s licence holder - 23 or 24 years old ....................12 points ▶Driver’s licence holder 25 or older ..................................15 points Chapter 1The driver22 | Driver’s HandbookLicence classesThere are 13 licence classes in Québec. Each class authorizes you to drive a certain category of vehicle on Québec roads.Once you have been issued a licence to drive a particular class of vehicle, other classes of vehicles are generally authorized, as shown in the following table under the heading “Classes included”.To obtain an additional classYou cannot go directly from one class to another. Before applying for a particular class, you have to meet certain conditions, which may require driving experience of one to three years or a satisfactory health care professional’s report on fitness to drive.To get a licence, go to an SAAQ service centre to take the knowledge and road tests, after passing an initial vision test.Some classes also require you to hold a learner’s licence or  probationary licence for a certain period.The main requirements are listed in the following table. Q  For further information on obtaining another licence class, you can find brochures specific to various classes either at SAAQ service centres, by contacting the SAAQ call centre (1 800 361-7620) or by visiting the Web site (saaq.gouv.qc.ca).

Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 35Health requirementsDriving safely not only demands road safety know-how and skills, but also a state of health that is consistent with the operation of a particular type of vehicle and its use.Some illnesses, impairments or situations are incompatible with safely driving a road vehicle. The Regulation respecting access to driving a road vehicle in connection with the health of drivers describes these cases. These include sight disorders, cardiovascular disease, mental illnesses, alcoholism, drug dependency, epilepsy, diabetes, kidney or respiratory disease.When applying for a licence or on renewal, you have an obligation to advise the SAAQ of any health condition that might affect your driving, and accordingly must fill out and sign the Declaration of Illness or Impairment form. The SAAQ must also be informed of any change in your state of health within 30 days.Your particular health condition may affect your eligibility to drive or lead to the refusal for or withdrawal of classes of licences and restrict your driving privileges. However, the most common situation is one in which the SAAQ issues a licence with conditions, in  particular the following: ▶Requiring the driver to wear eye glasses, contact lenses or a hearing aid; ▶Requiring the installation of equipment in the vehicle to assist driving; ▶Limiting the time of day, period and area for driving; ▶Limiting the types of vehicles that can be driven; ▶Allowing the person to drive only a vehicle that is equipped with an alcohol ignition interlock device. Chapter 1The driver36 | Driver’s HandbookOne or more of the following conditions may appear on a  driver’s licence:AMust wear glasses or contact lenses when drivingBMust drive only during the daytimeCMust wear a hearing aid when driving (Classes 2, 4A, 4B and 4C)D*Must undergo a medical examination every five years E*Must undergo a medical examination every six months F*Must undergo a medical examination every yearG*Must undergo a medical examination every two yearsHMust drive only a vehicle with a net weight of less than 2,500 kgIMust drive a vehicle fitted with an alcohol ignition interlock device following a medical diagnosisJMust drive a vehicle with an automatic transmissionKMust drive a vehicle with power steeringLMust drive a vehicle equipped with power brakesNMust wear a safety harness when drivingPMust drive only a vehicle equipped with hand-operated controlsQMust drive a vehicle with a manual control to adjust the  brightness of the headlightsRMust drive only a vehicle equipped with an accelerator on the leftSSubject to medical restrictions as indicated on the licenceVMust drive a vehicle with controls adapted to the  holder’s handicapWMust not drive a vehicle requiring Classes 1, 2, 3 and 4B  in the U.S.XMust drive a vehicle fitted with an alcohol ignition interlock device following a criminal convictionYMust comply with the zero alcohol rule* This condition does not appear on the licence, but is entered in the licence holder’s record. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 37The SAAQ can require you to take a proficiency examination or undergo a health assessment in any of the following cases: ▶You are 70 years of age or older; ▶The licence authorizes you to drive a tractor semitrailer,  tractor-trailer, straight-body truck, road train, bus or minibus, emergency vehicle or taxi cab; ▶You have not undergone an examination within the last 10 years; ▶The SAAQ has reasonable grounds to verify your health or  driving behaviour on public roads; ▶You have not been authorized to drive a road vehicle for three years or longer.Proficiency examinations, whether a knowledge or road test, can be required if you want to change a licence class. A health assessment can also be required before changing one of the conditions that appear on your licence.The SAAQ can also require you to provide a medical or optometric assessment at various intervals when an illness or impairment requires periodic follow-up.The SAAQ can suspend a licence or driver’s licence class if you: ▶Make a false health declaration or fail to declare a health condition; ▶Refuse to undergo a medical examination or assessment or fail to submit the report of such an examination; ▶Refuse to take or fail a proficiency test; ▶Are afflicted with an illness or disability that could jeopardize road safety. Chapter 1The driver38 | Driver’s HandbookDriver’s obligationsTo drive on a public roadway, you are required to hold and carry a valid licence, duly signed. You have to comply with the conditions that appear on the licence. A law enforcement officer may seize your vehicle if you do not hold the proper licence class for the vehicle driven and may impound the vehicle for 30 days.You are also required to have with you all documents related to the vehicle, that is: ▶A valid and duly signed registration certificate for the vehicle; ▶Valid proof of insurance coverage or certificate of financial  responsibility; ▶A lease contract (original or copy) for a vehicle leased for less than a one-year period; ▶Written proof of the period of the loan of a vehicle by a car dealer.If you drive or own a vehicle without third-party liability insurance, and become involved in an accident causing more than $500 in property damage, you are subject to licence suspension (driver’s licence, probationary licence or learner’s licence). The operation of any vehicle registered in your name is also prohibited, until the SAAQ is provided with a payment guarantee or proof of settlement covering the damage.The obligation to carry certain documents is not only for travelling on public roads. Some of them are also required on private roads open to public traffic, logging roads and shopping centre parking lots.For some drivers of heavy vehicles or vehicle combinations, other documentation may be required, such as the driving and duty time log, circle check inspection report or certain certificates, depending on the type of load or services provided.These documents must be shown to a peace officer on demand. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 39One document onlyIt is an offence to hold more than one valid driver’s licence,  probationary licence or learner’s licence issued by the SAAQ or another authority in Canada or the U.S. It is also prohibited to lend a licence to another person or provide false or misleading information to obtain one.The right addressThe address that appears on your licence must be your principal place of residence. Under the Highway Safety Code, you must notify the SAAQ of any change of address within 30 days, or be subject to penalties set out in the Code.You can do so on the SAAQ Web site at saaq.gouv.qc.ca, by mail, in person at a service centre or by telephone at 1 800 361-7620. The SAAQ will then send you a confirmation, which must be kept with your licence.Replacing a licenceWhen a licence is illegible, damaged, lost, destroyed, stolen or if information becomes invalid, you are required to apply to the SAAQ to have it replaced. The SAAQ will issue a replacement on payment of the required fee and presentation of two valid pieces of identification. Chapter 1The driver40 | Driver’s HandbookRenewing a licenceAlthough a plastic licence with a photo is intended to last four years, the associated driving privilege is only valid for one year. You are required to pay a licence fee each year, even if you do not receive a notice to do so. The portion of fees for the insurance contribution is set based on the number of demerit points in your driving record. If you do not make the payment, you cannot drive a road vehicle. Failure to comply with this obligation is an offence that may result in a minimum fine of $300, among other penalties.If your licence has been invalid for three years or more, you will need to pass a knowledge test and a road test before obtaining a licence again.Health declarationYou are required to declare any illnesses or disabilities when the SAAQ asks you to provide information on your state of health, and fill out the form for that purpose, in particular when obtaining or renewing a licence. You must also notify the SAAQ of any change in your health. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 41Obligations for persons from outside QuébecNew residentsIf you are a newly arrived resident of Québec, you may drive a passenger vehicle for six months without holding a Québec licence, provided you hold a valid driver’s licence.After six months, you must obtain a Québec licence, and you may have to take a proficiency examination: ▶If you hold a driver’s licence for a passenger vehicle  (equivalent to Class 5) issued by a Canadian  province or territory, the U.S., or a  country with which Québec has signed a licence exchange agreement, you may, upon settling in Québec, exchange this licence for a Class 5 licence issued by the SAAQ,  without taking a  proficiency  examination. Go the SAAQ Web site to find out which countries have signed such an agreement. Chapter 1The driver42 | Driver’s HandbookIf you take up residence in Québec and do not come from one of the jurisdictions listed on the previous page, the conditions vary according to the number of years you have held a valid driver’s licence corresponding to a Class 5: ▶If you have held a licence for at least one year at the time you take up residence in Québec, you must pass a knowledge exam and road test before the SAAQ can issue you a licence; ▶If you have held a licence for less than one year, the licence is not recognized by the SAAQ; you are therefore subject to the same requirements as applicants for their first driver’s licence.Everyone who comes from outside Québec must obtain a valid Québec driver’s licence for any vehicle other than a passenger vehicle. Q  For more information about conditions for exchanging a driver’s licence, contact the SAAQ call centre (514 954-7771 or 1 888 356-6616) or go to the Web site at saaq.gouv.qc.ca. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 43Non-residents If you are from outside Québec, you can drive in Québec for a period of not more than six consecutive months without holding a licence issued by the SAAQ. However, you must hold a valid licence issued by a jurisdiction that grants the same right to Québec residents, drive only a vehicle covered by the licence and comply with the conditions that appear on it.If you are a student, cooperant or trainee enrolled in a Québec educational institution, you are not required to obtain a Québec licence to drive a passenger vehicle for the duration of your studies or internship, on the condition, however, that your licence has been issued by a jurisdictional authority that grants the same right to Québec residents.If you hold an international driver’s permit issued by your country of origin, you may drive road vehicles authorized by your driver’s licence during the validity period of that permit.An international driver’s permit must always be accompanied by the original, valid driver’s licence. Chapter 1The driver44 | Driver’s HandbookA REVOKED OR SUSPENDED LICENCEThis section is a summary of the consequences of suspensions and revocations in connection with offences committed on the road.  Q  To find out more,  visit the SAAQ Web site at saaq.gouv.qc.ca.Revoking a licence means that the licence becomes invalid. If your licence is revoked, you lose your right to drive a road vehicle for a determined period. To get a new licence, you must abide by the conditions provided under the Highway Safety Code.Suspending a licence means that the licence becomes  temporarily invalid. Lastly, suspending your right to obtain a licence means that the SAAQ cannot issue any licence for a determined period. This penalty can also be imposed on people who have never had a licence.Revocation or suspension of a licence or of the right to obtain one may result from: ▶An unpaid fine for an offence under the Highway Safety Code or a municipal traffic or parking regulation; ▶Accumulated demerit points resulting from offences under the Highway Safety Code; ▶A conviction for an offence under the Criminal Code related to driving a road vehicle; ▶An arrest for an offence related to alcohol- or drug- impaired driving; ▶An interception by a peace officer, in particular following an offence for excessive speeding, street racing or car surfing. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 45You should note that the SAAQ is informed of certain offences committed in other Canadian provinces or territories or an American state that has made a reciprocity agreement with Québec. Demerit points are entered on a driving record for these offences, in the same way as if they were committed in Québec.Suspension for an unpaid fineIf you do not pay fines imposed following an offence under the Highway Safety Code or a municipal traffic or parking regulation, the SAAQ will suspend any learner’s licence, probationary licence or driver’s licence that you hold, or the right to obtain one if you do not hold a licence. A written notice will be sent to you before the suspension comes into effect. The suspension is applied in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Penal Procedure and remains in effect until the SAAQ has been notified that the fine has been paid.Consequences of a suspension ▶You are prohibited from driving a vehicle for the duration of any suspension. ▶If you contravene the prohibition to drive a vehicle, a peace officer can seize, at the owner’s expense, the vehicle you are driving for a period of 30 days and give the owner a fine of between $300 and $600, in addition to judicial costs. Chapter 1The driver46 | Driver’s HandbookThe seizure and impoundment can be for 90 days if you have had, during the 10 previous years, a prohibition from acquiring, registering, renting or leasing, or putting into operation a road vehicle because of an offence for alcohol- or drug-impaired driving.  ▶It is prohibited for any such offenders to purchase or lease a road vehicle. ▶It is prohibited for any such offenders to sell or transfer a  vehicle that they own. ▶It is prohibited for any such offenders to operate a  vehicle  registered under their name or allow the vehicle to be operated.Demerit pointsThe SAAQ enters demerit points on the records of drivers who commit certain offences under the Highway Safety Code, or any other law or regulation dealing with road safety.To learn more about such offences and related fines and number of demerit points, please refer to the list of Highway Safety Code offences in Chapter 6 of this publication, entitled “Offences and Consequences”.Accumulating demerit pointsIf you hold a learner’s licence or probationary licence and have accumulated four or more demerit points on your record, the SAAQ will revoke your licence. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 47The SAAQ also revokes licences of drivers who have reached the maximum number of demerit points in the point bracket to which they are subject, based on their age: ▶Drivers under age 23  .........................................8 points or more; ▶Drivers age 23 or 24  ........................................12 points or more; ▶Drivers age 25 or older ....................................15 points or more.Points are entered on the driving record once the SAAQ receives a notice of judgment that confirms a conviction and not on the date of the offence or judgment. If the maximum number of points has been reached in your driving record, you will receive a notice to inform you of the impending licence revocation.Driving a vehicle during a penalty period is an offence under the Highway Safety Code, subject to a fine of $600 to $2,000, as well as the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle driven for 30 days.If you are a heavy vehicle driver covered by the Act respecting owners, operators and drivers of heavy vehicles, a taxi driver or an emergency vehicle driver, you are required to inform the person responsible for the heavy vehicle, or the owner of the taxi or emergency vehicle if your driver’s licence (or a licence class) has been changed, suspended or revoked.Before obtaining a licence againIf your licence has been revoked or if your right to obtain a licence has been suspended because of demerit points, you can only obtain a new licence after the time period prescribed by the Highway Safety Code. Chapter 1The driver48 | Driver’s HandbookAfter four demerit points on recordUnder the provisions of the Highway Safety Code, four or more demerit points entered on a new driver’s record result in a licence revocation for a minimum three-month period, during which you cannot obtain a new licence. This measure particularly concerns: ▶Holders of a Class 5 or 6A learner’s licence who are not already a driver’s licence holder; ▶Holders of a probationary licence; ▶Holders of a Class 6D licence (authorizing them to drive a  motorized scooter or moped) or a Class 8 licence  (authorizing them to drive a farm tractor) who have had their licence for less than five years.Given that holders of a learner’s licence or probationary licence must have 12 and 24 months of driving experience respectively with a valid licence, the duration of their licence will be prolonged to take into account the period during which the licence was not valid.At the end of the penalty period, if you held a probationary licence, you must pass a reinstatement test before obtaining a new licence. If you were a learner’s licence holder, you are required to go to an SAAQ service centre to obtain a new licence and the right to drive that you previously had. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 49After 8, 12 or 15 points on recordUnder the provisions of the Highway Safety Code, a licence  revocation or the suspension of the right to obtain one is required for a 3-, 6- or 12-month period. These periods are determined based on whether it is the first, second or third time that you have accumulated 8, 12 or 15 demerit points (and depending on your age) over the two previous years.To obtain a new driver’s licence, you have to pass a knowledge test. Make an appointment in advance, the date of which will be calcu-lated taking into account that the penalty period must have ended at the time of the test. You will also have to pay the test fees and the required amount for the licence. It is important to note that the cost of the licence will be increased since the insurance contribution payable is set based on the number of demerit points entered on your driving record.Demerit points and driving recordDemerit points stay on record for two years following the date of conviction or the date that the fine is paid (paying a fine is equiva-lent to a conviction).Each time the SAAQ revokes a driver’s licence because of an  accumulation of demerit points, it subtracts 8, 12 or 15 points from the record for a driver’s licence or 4 points for a learner’s licence or a probationary licence, depending on the situation. However, any additional points remain on record for two years following the date of the most recent conviction or payment of a fine. Chapter 1The driver50 | Driver’s HandbookFor example, if you have 14 demerit points on record and you commit an offence that brings the number of points to 16, because at least 15 points are on your record, your licence is revoked, and 15 points are erased from your record. Therefore, one point remains on your record, which will be erased two years after the date of conviction for the most recent offence.No demerit points are erased when renewing a learner’s, probation-ary or driver’s licence, nor when issuing a first licence or obtaining a new licence after a revocation.Restricted licence and demerit pointsIf your licence has been suspended or revoked because of an initial accumulation of demerit points during the two previous years (4 points if it is a probationary licence or 8, 12 or 15 points for a driver’s licence, depending on your age), you might be able to obtain a restricted licence. However, your main livelihood must require you to drive a road vehicle. To obtain a restricted licence, file a motion with the Court of Québec and inform the SAAQ. When the motion is heard, you will have to prove to the judge that you need to drive for work.The order of the judge must be provided to the SAAQ, who will then issue the restricted licence. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 51Criminal Code offencesThe Criminal Code is a federal law that codifies all criminal offences subject to prosecution in Canada and specifies their corresponding sentences. The Criminal Code applies to any individual who commits a criminal offence in a Canadian province or territory.People found guilty of certain offences described in the section of the Criminal Code concerning offences relating to conveyances will have their licence revoked or their right to obtain one suspended. Such offences include: ▶Dangerous driving; ▶Failure to stop (failure to stop when being pursued by police or when involved in an accident); ▶Driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and blood drug concentration (BDC) that is equal to or exceeds the BAC and the BDC for the drug that are prescribed by regulation for instances where alcohol and that drug are combined; ▶Driving with a BDC equal to or exceeding the BDC prescribed by regulation; ▶Driving or having the care or control of a vehicle when the ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs; ▶Driving or having the care or control of a vehicle with a BAC over 0.08 (80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood); ▶Refusal to obey the orders of a peace officer (for example, to provide a breath sample or to submit to a physical coordination test). Chapter 1The driver52 | Driver’s HandbookMinimum period during which it is impossible to obtain a licenceAfter a revocation, it is impossible for an offender to obtain a licence for a minimum period which is determined based on the type of Criminal Code offence and the number of convictions. The length of this prohibition corresponds to the period ordered by the judge at the time of conviction and the period prescribed by the Highway Safety Code, whichever is longer, based on the following: ▶First conviction one year, or four years for a failure to stop; ▶Second conviction (within a 10-year reference period)  three years, or five years for a failure to stop; ▶Third conviction five years.Note that the period during which the driver is not authorized to obtain a new licence could be longer than what is prescribed in the Highway Safety Code if the judge issues an order to this effect.In addition, offenders may have to fulfill certain conditions in order to obtain a new driver’s licence (for example, passing a knowledge test). In the case of an impaired driving offence, other conditions also apply (see further on).When any of the previously listed offences is committed in another province or territory, or when such an offence is committed in an American state with which Québec has signed a reciprocity agree-ment, the offence is entered on the driver’s record, and the driver is subject to the same penalties as if it had occurred in Québec. There are many consequences of Criminal Code offences, and they depend on various factors.Chapter 6 of this publication, entitled “Offences and Consequences” indicates the main offences and provides information on penalties and measures provided under the Criminal Code and the Highway Safety Code following a conviction for a criminal offence. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 53Driving while impairedDriving while impaired by alcohol, drugs or medication is a dangerous behaviour that is severely punished under the Criminal Code and the Highway Safety Code.The Criminal CodeThe Criminal Code sets out the rules and penalties that apply in the event of driving offences involving alcohol, drugs and medication: prison time, fines, driving prohibition periods, etc.You could be arrested and convicted if:Your blood alcohol concentration is over 80 mg of  alcohol per 100 ml of blood (0.08)At any time you are driving a vehicle, a police officer can order you to blow into an approved screening device or, if he or she suspects you  have consumed alcohol, submit you to roadside physical coor-dination tests. Based on the results, the police officer may arrest you and take you to the police station in order to measure your blood alcohol concentration using a breathalyzer. If your blood alcohol concentration is equal to or over 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (0.08), you could face Criminal Code charges. Chapter 1The driver54 | Driver’s HandbookYou have drugs or certain medications in your systemIf a police officer suspects that you have consumed drugs or certain medications, you may be required to submit to physical coordination tests or take a saliva test. These tests are enough for the police officer to place you under arrest and require that you provide a blood sample.For example, if your blood sample contains a concentration of cannabis (THC) that is above the concentration prescribed by federal regulation, you could face Criminal Code charges. The prescribed blood drug concentrations for cannabis are as follows: ▶2 nanograms of THC per millilitre of blood ▶5 nanograms of THC per millilitre of blood ▶2.5 nanograms of THC per millilitre of blood, combined with a blood alcohol concentration equal to or over 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of bloodFor all other federally controlled drugs, any detectable trace at all is enough to face charges, with the exception of GHB.Your ability to drive is impaired by alcohol, drugs or medicationIf a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that you are impaired by alcohol or drugs (including medication) or a combination of alcohol and a drug, he or she can place you under arrest without having you take any tests.If a police officer suspects that you have consumed alcohol, drugs or medication, you may be required to submit to physical coordination tests, to blow into an alcohol screening device or to take a saliva test. At any time you are driving a vehicle, a police officer can order you to blow into an approved screening device. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 55These tests are enough for the police officer to place you under arrest and bring you to the police station in order to have you undergo another series of tests by an evaluating officer. The evaluating officer may measure your blood alcohol concentration using a breathalyzer, if you are suspected of having consumed alcohol. If the evaluating officer concludes that your ability to drive was impaired, you could face Criminal Code charges.You refuse to obey the orders of a peace officerRefusing to submit to the tests ordered by a police officer is a criminal offence that automatically results in the stiffest penalties. CARE OR CONTROL OF A VEHICLEThe law not only prohibits impaired driving, but also having the care or control of a vehicle while impaired. Here are some situations that can have the same consequences as impaired driving: ▶sitting in the driver’s seat, even if the vehicle is stopped or broken down ▶being in the vehicle (even asleep on the back seat) and having the  possibility of starting the engine ▶being near the vehicle, for example to brush snow off the car or put things in the trunkThe police officer will assess whether it was possible for the person to drive the vehicle and whether he or she intended to drive. Chapter 1The driver56 | Driver’s HandbookThe Highway Safety CodeThe Highway Safety Code is a provincial law that applies only in Québec. It sets out administrative measures and penalties that can be imposed for impaired driving.If your blood alcohol concentration is equal to or over 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (0.08) ▶Immediate licence suspension for 90 days ▶Immediate seizure and impoundment of the vehicle for 90 days, in the case of a repeat offenceIf your blood alcohol concentration is equal to or over 160 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (0.16) ▶Immediate licence suspension for 90 days ▶Immediate seizure and impoundment of the vehicle for 30 days (90 days, in the case of a repeat offence)  ▶Program to assess and reduce the risk of impaired driving ▶Alcohol ignition interlock device (depending on the situation)Refusing to obey the orders of a peace officer ▶Immediate licence suspension for 90 days ▶Immediate seizure and impoundment of the vehicle for 30 days (90 days, in the case of a repeat offence)  ▶Program to assess and reduce the risk of impaired driving ▶Alcohol ignition interlock device (depending on the situation)Zero alcohol for drivers under age 22, learner drivers and holders of a probationary licence ▶Immediate licence suspension for 90 days ▶4 demerit points ▶Fine of $300 to $600 Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 57Zero alcohol for bus, minibus and taxi drivers ▶Prohibition from driving these kinds of vehicles for 24 hoursLimit of 0.05 for heavy vehicle drivers ▶Prohibition from driving these kinds of vehicles for 24 hoursFailing the tests carried out by an evaluating officer at the police station (impaired driving due to drugs or medication, or by a combination of alcohol and drugs) ▶Immediate licence suspension for 90 days ▶Immediate seizure and impoundment of the vehicle for 90 days, in the case of a repeat offenceAlternative solutionsThere are a number of alternative solutions to avoid driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs: ▶Take a taxi or public transit ▶Have a designated driver for the evening ▶Sleep over, if you’re at a friend’s house ▶Call a drive-home service, such as Operation Red Nose or Tolérance Zéro. Chapter 1The driver58 | Driver’s HandbookFACTORS THAT INFLUENCE DRIVINGAt first glance, driving may appear fairly simple. However, just knowing how to start, steer and stop a vehicle is not enough to know how to drive. You also need to know how to make decisions that take into account other road users, and traffic and road conditions.In addition to offences, the annual number of road accident victims is still high enough to show that driving is difficult.Driving a vehicle calls on you to act on what you already know, as well as on information you gather while travelling. You need to be aware of what is going on around you, plan what to do and anticipate the reactions of other road users in order to make decisions. Your decisions reflect your assessment of a given situation. For example, when approaching an intersection, it is not enough simply to recog-nize a stop sign. To decide how fast to slow down and where to stop, you also have to assess the distance before the stop sign, take into account the speed of the vehicle, the condition of the roadway and whether there are other road users.Whether you are a novice or an experienced driver, you will notice that most of the time your driving is subject to influences like your health, personality and environment. Your decisions are influenced by your dominant character traits, feelings and your general state. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 59Because driving is complex, it is important to remember that your physical and mental condition are important and are directly connected to your skill in using the road network.VisionVision plays a fundamental role in safely driving an automobile. Studies have shown that 90% of the information necessary for driving is gathered through sight. Any significant impairment to your visual functions decreases your performance on the road, especially when it comes to making decisions, which increases your risk of accident and the unfortunate consequences that can result.Vision has several functions that help you form an accurate repre-sentation or picture of your environment. If one of these functions is lacking or seriously weakened, especially if you are not aware of it, you may be unfit to drive.Visual acuityVisual acuity is the ability to clearly distinguish the details of objects at a certain distance. The level of precision can vary greatly from one person to the next. Some people whose visual acuity is lower than average do not realize that they are not seeing many details they think they see as well as anyone else. This phenomenon is particularly associated with aging and a person’s state of health. Only regular examinations can detect a progressive deterioration of visual acuity. Chapter 1The driver60 | Driver’s HandbookField of visionYour field of vision is the expanse of space in which objects are perceived while your eyes focus on one particular point. Your field of vision must be large enough for you to see, in a single glance, all of the obstacles that could appear suddenly in front of or on either side of your vehicle. A clear field of vision is just as important as good eyesight. If it is obscured, your risk of accident increases.As a vehicle accelerates, your visual field shrinks, in the same way that it does when your eye focuses on one object. Drugs, alcohol and fatigue often produce the same effect. Eye problems or neurological problems can also cause a significant loss of visual field.Glasses with temples that are too wide can also have an impact on your visual field.Stereoscopic visionStereoscopic vision, or depth vision, makes it possible for you to accurately situate objects in three-dimensional space. You can also assess the distance separating the vehicle from other objects around it, even if those objects are in motion.Corrective lensesIt is dangerous to drive without wearing any corrective lenses that you may require (glasses or contact lenses). If you have this requirement, it appears on your driver’s licence as Condition A. Failure to comply with the condition is an offence, and makes you liable to a fine. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 61Night visionNo matter what kind of vision you have, driving at night is riskier than driving during the day. Drivers have to adapt their driving because of the limited range of their headlights.Road signs are designed to reflect light, so that they can be seen from far away when a vehicle’s headlights hit them, which is not the case for non-reflective objects. You can only see those close up. For this reason, it is important to base your estimate on the visibil-ity of reflective objects so that you do not misjudge the range of your headlights.The two following factors are important in night vision: ▶Ability to see in low-light conditions; ▶Resistance to glare.As you get older, your ability to recover after encountering glare decreases. When driving at night becomes particularly demanding, you should be even more cautious.Lastly, you should not wear dark glasses when driving at night, because they reduce your visual acuity.Physical problemsSome physical illnesses can be direct causes of road accidents. Health care professionals can notify the SAAQ of the names and addresses of people 14 years of age or older who are considered to be unfit, whether medically or due to a visual problem, to drive a road vehicle. No action in damages can be brought against a health care profes-sional who makes such a report. Chapter 1The driver62 | Driver’s HandbookThe SAAQ can suspend your licence, change its conditions or even refuse to issue a licence because of your state of health. The SAAQ can also require you to undergo a new examination or assessment by a health care professional. All responsible drivers should comply with recommendations of their doctor.Some discomfort is temporary, but physical problems like a migraine, fever, etc. make driving difficult and demanding. In such circumstances, you should avoid driving. If you experience physical discomfort or illness while driving, you should stop your vehicle in a safe area.Fatigue and mental stateFatigue at the wheel should not be taken lightly, since it can decrease your performance even if you are a careful driver, and can sometimes have disastrous consequences.Fatigue can cause drowsiness, which can also be caused by other things, such as a heavy meal. However, the most common causes of drowsiness are lack of sleep, a monotonous road, lack of familiarity with night driving or when the temperature of your car is too warm.Drowsiness affects your attention. You should regard warning signs of fatigue as a clear warning that you are risking an accident.Because fatigue slows down movements in general, when you feel tired, yawn, have itchy eyes, or brief hallucinations, you should know that it is time to stop. Stretching exercises can be a good way of lessening fatigue on long trips. Sometimes, all you need is a few minutes of rest to bring back your alertness, but sleep is really the only way to recoup your strength when drowsiness sets in. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 63Your physical condition is important for driving, but so is your mental or psychological condition. If you are experiencing psychological stress or strong emotions like sadness or anger, you should not drive.Electronic devicesDrivers are prohibited from using an electronic device while  operating a vehicle. From the moment a driver holds an electronic device in his or her hands or in any other way, he or she is presumed to be using the device. The law applies to all devices, whether or not they are activated, such as: ▶Cell phones; ▶MP3 players or portable multimedia players; ▶Portable satellite radios; ▶Electronic tablets; ▶Screens that display information that is not of use when driving; ▶Devices that display emails and make it possible to browse the Internet.While the hands-free operation of an electronic device is permitted, it is not a safer option and not advisable, as the simple act of talking on a telephone is a distraction. Meaning of the expression “while driving”If you bring your vehicle to a stop for road signs, traffic signals or traffic obstructions, you are still considered to be driving. You are considered to be controlling a vehicle so as to comply with road signs and traffic signals or to avoid traffic obstructions. Therefore, if you are waiting at a red light or are in a traffic jam, you are considered to be driving a vehicle and therefore cannot use an electronic device. Chapter 1The driver64 | Driver’s HandbookHowever, if you bring your vehicle to a safe and legal stop at the side of the road to use an electronic device, you are no longer considered to be driving, even if the vehicle’s engine is running. CBs are authorizedUse of devices that have been installed in the vehicle dashboard or are mounted on the dashboard and only the microphone or receiver is held in the hand, are not prohibited.This applies to high frequency radio communication equipment, such as central battery telephone systems or portable transmitters- receivers, more commonly known as CBs and walkie-talkies.Safety tipsAs a motorist, you are responsible for driving safely. You should therefore keep the following safety tips in mind: ▶Turn off your electronic device before leaving and let your voice mail take all messages. ▶If you absolutely have to use your electronic device, pull off the road to a place where parking is allowed and it is safe for you and other road users. For example: ▷The side of a road where the speed limit is 70 km/h or less; ▷A parking lot; ▷A service area. ▶Remember that, except in an emergency, no one is allowed to bring a vehicle to a stop on the shoulder of a highway or on highway access and exit ramps. ▶You could also ask a passenger to handle the device or make a call for you.  Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 65Legal consequences First offence ▶Five demerit points added to the offender’s driving record;  ▶$300 to $600 fine.Repeat offenceFor a repeat offence, in addition to another five demerit points, the minimum fine doubles to $600 and the offender’s driver’s licence is immediately suspended as follows:  ▶First repeat offence*: 3 days ▶Second repeat offence*: 7 days ▶Third or additional repeat offence*: 30 days* 2-year reference period. Chapter 1The driver66 | Driver’s HandbookAlcoholDrinking and driving is a major social concern, with good reason! In Québec, alcohol is a factor in collisions associated with  approximately 32% of deaths, 16% of serious injuries and 5% of minor injuries. On average, from 2006 to 2010, these percentages translated into 185 deaths and more than 2,500 injuries annually.Drinking alcohol can make drivers take risks. Today we recognize that alcohol decreases driving ability. The more you drink, the less capable you are of making good decisions in terms of road safety.Lastly, if you drive while you are impaired by alcohol, you have a very high risk of causing a serious accident, which could result both in penalties that have become even harsher and in dire consequences.Drinking a single glass of alcohol can sometimes cause the effects previously mentioned, even if your blood alcohol level is less than 0.08 (80 mg per 100 ml of blood), since already 0.05 (50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood) in an average adult can cause significant impair-ment. In addition, it is important to emphasize that young drivers are more affected by alcohol, even in small amounts. For example, with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.03 (30 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood), the risk of being involved in a fatal accident is three times higher for a driver between 16 and 19 years of age.These effects can also happen quickly if you have not eaten or are tired. The more you drink, the more you risk becoming impaired. If you have been drinking, you simply should not drive.There are many opportunities to drink. It is important to remember to limit the effects of alcohol and to get in the habit of moderation. If you are having family or friends over, you should encourage them them to be cautious. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 67Below are a series of things you can do, but you should still be careful:  ▶Drink slowly and in small quantities; ▶Eat; ▶Suggest non-alcoholic beverages (and why not water?); ▶Pace yourself; ▶Stop serving alcoholic beverages at least one hour before the end of the evening; ▶Make arrangements not to drive when you have been drinking, for example, have someone else drive you, take a taxi or the bus, or use a drive-home service; ▶If one of your guests has had too much to drink, ask him or her to stay over; ▶Plan ahead.Some people wrongly believe that drinking alcohol regularly is a guarantee against becoming impaired. Although, it is recognized that the body of a person who drinks regularly adapts, only an illu-sion of sobriety is apparent and the person can overestimate his or her driving ability.Certain suggested ways of decreasing the effects of alcohol are rarely effective. For example, some people believe that eating while drinking makes the body eliminate alcohol more quickly. Alcohol takes effect in the blood more slowly because of food, but it does not prevent you from reaching an elevated blood alcohol level.Remember that when you drink alcohol, 90% of it is eliminated by your liver. The liver of a person in good health works at a regular rhythm, and it can only eliminate a certain number of milligrams per hour.Taking a walk or shower does not work either. There is no miraculous way of eliminating alcohol and its effects. Only time can do that. Chapter 1The driver68 | Driver’s HandbookMain effects of drinking alcohol on drivingOn observation ▶Rather than scanning the road ahead, to the sides and occasionally behind, if you are under the influence of alcohol, you tend to focus on one spot or object ahead: you pay less attention to vehicles, persons and objects on or near the road. ▶You are less able to estimate distances between objects. ▶You are less able to adapt to darkness. ▶At night, you have difficulty focusing after encountering the glare of an oncoming vehicle and the time it takes to adjust after the vehicle has passed is longer than normal. ▶You have a decreased sense of danger, and you therefore take more risks.On decision making ▶Brain activity is slowed. ▶You are less able to recognize a problem situation. ▶Making a quick decision is difficult.On execution ▶The effects of alcohol result in overconfidence in your abilities. ▶Slower brain activity results in a loss of muscular coordination. Since you are slow to realize that you have to act, limb movements are often abrupt and imprecise. You find it difficult to stay in your lane, go through an intersection, change lanes, make a turn, control the vehicle and even come to a stop. Alcohol can also affect your balance if you are riding a motorcycle. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 69Drugs and medicationAll drugs (cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, etc.) and certain  medications (anxiolytics, antidepressants, sedatives, etc.) have effects that impair your ability to drive. In combination with alcohol, the risk of accident increases significantly.Effects of cannabis on drivingWhile cannabis use may be legal, driving under the influence of cannabis is dangerous and prohibited. Cannabis causes a decrease in vigilance and concentration, slower reflexes, poor coordination, longer reaction times and impaired judgment.Other possible effects ▶A strong tendency not to notice road signs and traffic signals ▶Veering off the road ▶Difficulty maintaining a constant trajectory ▶Unsafe passing manoeuvres ▶Longer braking time ▶Difficulty reacting in emergency situationsMedications: Some safety precautionsDrivers taking medication must make a reasonable assessment of whether it is compatible with safely operating a vehicle. Taken alone, some medications have effects similar to alcohol. This is particularly true for minor tranquilizers or sleeping pills.Antihistamines (in the form of syrup or pills) to relieve allergy or cold symptoms can also cause drowsiness. If you are using this type of medication, you should read the label carefully and ask a physi-cian or pharmacist about side effects and the likely impact on your ability to drive. Chapter 1The driver70 | Driver’s HandbookIf you are taking medication, you should not drink alcohol. Combining substances is dangerous because the effects of medication and alcohol can be amplified, multiplying the effects of both, and causing you significant impairment, making you unable to drive.Your mind-setAlthough, as a driver, your physical health is important, so is your mental health. Your personality traits often make themselves known through your behaviour at the controls of a motor vehicle, which provides an individual with a feeling of independence and serves as an outlet for emotions.Some drivers show self-respect and consideration. In a difficult  driving situation, their decisions are based on tolerance, patience and foresight. They are fully aware of the inherent danger involved in operating a motor vehicle, and their skills and driving habits improve with experience.However, some situations are more likely to lead to conflicts between drivers, for example, city rush hours or getting on and off highways. People react in a wide variety of ways to traffic jams. To avoid making a bad situation worse, you need to moderate your behaviour and anticipate possible danger.Moreover, in order to avoid dangerous situations, the Highway Safety Code specifies that all road users must be careful and considerate when travelling on a public highway, especially toward more vulnerable users. Accordingly, cyclists must protect pedestrians by adopting safe practices when riding. Drivers must protect more vulnerable users (motorcyclists, cyclists, pedestrians, etc.) by exhibiting extra care in their presence. Vulnerable users, for their part, have a duty to adopt behaviours that enhance their own safety.Regardless of the cause of a traffic problem, it is sometimes best just to slow down and, if necessary, pull off to the side of the road. This does not mean being passive; it means being alert. Chapter 1The driver1Driver’s Handbook | 71There are also other ways to avoid conflict situations. To be a good driver, you should plan ahead, choosing travel times and routes that make it possible to avoid traffic congestion and the likelihood of an accident. These are preferable alternatives to using the shoulder of the road or stop-and-go tactics to move forward faster than the person ahead.ObservationObserving the immediate surroundings and checking on all sides of the vehicle are key to determining if you can safely pass a vehicle, change lanes, proceed through an intersection or merge with traf-fic. By looking ahead of you, on both sides and behind, you gather the information you need to decide when you should steer your vehicle in a given direction. Then, if necessary, you will be able to yield the right of way to other road users and adapt your speed to traffic conditions. Otherwise, you will be in conflict with other users and have a greater risk of being involved in an accident or other unpleasant situation.You need to think about what could happen if you go through an intersection without stopping or checking, or if you pass someone without checking to see if there is another vehicle in the oncoming lane. These types of behaviours can often result in serious accidents and victims who had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Negligence increases the risk of accidents. Chapter 1The driver72 | Driver’s HandbookStaying alert and exercising your judgmentA greater number of accidents occur at night and on weekends, so you should be especially vigilant during these times. Any situation could become distracting when you are driving. The possibility of human error is all around, in the vehicle ahead or behind, in the oncoming vehicle or the one passing you. You have to stay alert.You also need to use your judgment at all times. You should constantly exercise caution, since possibilities for error and accidents are numerous.Unexpected situations may call for reduced speed. Road building or repair work, a mishap, fog, etc., may test your patience and leave little time for proper response. All drivers will encounter situations that are beyond their control, for example a traffic light may be defective, the driver in front may appear lost or is driving too slowly or any other unexpected situation may cause you to lengthen or change your route.This is when you need to exercise judgment. Obviously, no one takes pleasure in yielding to or being intimidated by other drivers or appearing unable to take a risk. However, a hasty action can lead to a dramatic situation. Inconvenience or delay is the small price a smart driver is willing to pay for safer roads. 2THE VEHICLECHAPTER 2 Chapter 2The vehicle74 | Driver’s HandbookIn Québec, all road vehicles, regardless of their use, must be  registered in with the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ), unless they are exempt under the Highway Safety Code.In addition, vehicle owners must pay the required annual amount if they want to operate their vehicle.The Highway Safety Code and its regulations also require vehicle owners to maintain their vehicles properly and to ensure that they have the features and accessories required by law. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 75VEHICLE REGISTRATIONGeneral provisionsIf you are a vehicle owner, you are required to apply for your  registration as soon as you take possession of your vehicle or before the temporary registration obtained from a vehicle dealer expires. If you are newly settled in Québec, you have to apply to register your vehicle within six months of your arrival.The registration remains valid for as long as the vehicle and the owner remain the same.When the vehicle is registered, the SAAQ issues a licence plate and registration certificate that corresponds to the vehicle owner and category type, its use and place of operation. Chapter 2The vehicle76 | Driver’s HandbookVehicles exempt from registrationRegistration is not required for road vehicles that are not used on public roads, including the following most common ones: ▶Snowblowers with a net weight of 900 kg or less; ▶Farm tractors that are not used on public roads; ▶Snowmobiles with a net weight of 55 kg or less and a maximum speed under 15 km/h; ▶Snowmobiles, with a net weight of 450 kg or less that are owned by a person who does not reside in Québec provided that the snowmobile is registered in compliance with the laws of the owner’s place of residence or head office; ▶Motorized toy vehicles that can carry one person; ▶Golf carts; ▶Garden tractors, not including farm tractors, and riding mowers that carry one person; ▶Road vehicles used exclusively inside a building.Exceptionally, a farmer’s agricultural machinery, although it is exempt from registration, can be operated on a public roadway. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 77Obtaining registration and putting your vehicle into operationRequirementsTo register a vehicle and obtain the right to operate it on the road,  you must: ▶Meet the terms and conditions set out by regulation; ▶Pay all the fees set by regulation; ▶Following the purchase of a used vehicle, submit the odometer reading at the time of registration.In addition, you could be prohibited from registering a vehicle or having the right to register a vehicle if you have an unpaid fine, or if you are a repeat impaired driving offender.Owners of heavy vehicles (heavy vehicles or combinations of vehi-cles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,500 kg or more, buses, minibuses, tow trucks or road vehicles used to transport hazardous material) must enter their vehicles in the register of owners and operators of heavy vehicles kept by the Commission des Transports du Québec. Chapter 2The vehicle78 | Driver’s HandbookCost of registrationThe cost of registration varies based on the type of vehicle, and its use and place of operation. It includes: ▶The registration fee; ▶The contribution to the Québec automobile insurance plan and related taxes; ▶Administrative charges; ▶A public transit contribution, if applicable; ▶Any additional fees set by regulation to register specific road vehicles.Mandatory liability insuranceThe Automobile Insurance Act requires every vehicle owner to have third-party liability insurance coverage in the amount of at least $50,000. This is a legal obligation if you plan to drive on public roads in Québec.Special requirement for minorsIf you are under 18, and you want to register a vehicle, you have to provide the SAAQ with written consent from your parent or legal guardian.Cases in which vehicle  registration may be  deniedThe SAAQ will not register a vehicle if you cannot prove that you are the sole or joint owner, or prove that the vehicle is owned by a business in which you have an interest, or if you are subject to a measure prohibiting you from registering a vehicle. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 79Conditions relating to vehicle registrationSignatureYou must sign your registration certificate as soon as you receive it.Change of addressIf your name is on a vehicle registration certificate, you are required to inform the SAAQ of any change of address within 30 days. You can carry out the change of address by Internet (saaq.gouv.qc.ca).Motor vehicle liability insurance cardIf you drive, or have care or control of a motor vehicle, you must carry the vehicle’s registration certificate and vehicle liability insurance card, and be able to show them upon request by a peace officer.Licence plate installationSecurely attach your licence plate to the rear of your vehi-cle or elsewhere, as determined by regulation.However, owners of combination vehicles designed to pull a trailer (road tractor with a fifth wheel) must attach the licence plate to the front of the vehicle. Chapter 2The vehicle80 | Driver’s HandbookLegible and clean licence platesThe SAAQ determines what may appear on a licence plate.Keep your licence plate free of any matter that might prevent it from being clearly legible.The plate also needs to be properly lit at the rear to make it visible at night.A law enforcement officer may require you to clean the licence plate if it is so dirty that it is hard to read.No other plates allowedNo plate that might be confused with one issued by the SAAQ or an equivalent authority in another jurisdiction may be affixed to a vehicle, unless another Québec statute so requires.Certificate and plate replacementIf your registration certificate is damaged, illegible or lost, apply to the SAAQ for a replacement. A fee will be charged for the new certificate.Anyone who operates a vehicle with a licence plate that is so damaged that it is illegible is subject to a fine.Annual registration feesTo retain the right to drive your vehicle, you have to pay registration fees every year no later than the due date set by regulation. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 81No grace period is allowed for late payment. Pay the total amount on the payment notice unless you are storing your vehicle before the beginning of the new registration period. Additional charges are applied when registration fees are not paid before or by the deadline.You are not permitted to drive your vehicle if you owe the SAAQ any amounts.Discarding a vehicleYou are required to inform the SAAQ if you discard a vehicle because it can no longer be used and declare that you will not drive the vehicle anymore. You can do so by phone or on the SAAQ Web site.Before a discarded vehicle can be authorized for use once more on a public roadway, the vehicle needs to undergo a mechanical inspection at your expense, and you have to ensure that all repairs required to allow the vehicle to meet regulatory standards are made.Storing a vehicleIf you want to store your vehicle for an indefinite amount of time, you have to inform the SAAQ. You cannot drive your vehicle during the storage period, but the licence plate must remain on it. The SAAQ will issue you a receipt to confirm that the vehicle is in storage. If you make the storage application by telephone or on the SAAQ Web site, you will be sent a letter confirming the vehicle’s change of status. Chapter 2The vehicle82 | Driver’s HandbookReimbursementWhen a vehicle you own is discarded, placed in storage, sold, damaged, stolen or exported, you are entitled to be reimbursed for part of the amount paid to cover registration fees and the Québec automobile insurance plan contribution.Note that a compliant certificate of mechanical inspection, issued by an SAAQ agent, is required for a vehicle stored for more than 12 months if you want to put it back into operation.Ownership transferWhen the ownership of a vehicle is transferred, supporting documents are required, for example a piece of identification, power of attorney where another person is being represented, or a document giving parental consent in the case of a minor. You cannot transfer owner-ship of a road vehicle registered in your name if your registration or your right to register a vehicle has been suspended for an unpaid fine, or for a repeat offence in certain cases of impaired driving. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 83Vehicle purchased from an individualWhen buying a vehicle from an individual, both the buyer and the person selling the vehicle have to go an SAAQ service outlet. To cancel the vehicle registration, the seller has to hand in the registration certificate. Then a new registration certificate confirming the buyer as the new owner is issued. Before purchasing a vehicle, check with the SAAQ to make sure that the owner is entitled to sell it.Exchanging vehiclesWhen two people exchange road vehicles, each vehicle owner must apply for new registration and pay applicable fees.Transaction through a dealerIf you sell a road vehicle to a dealer, you must give the dealer the registration certificate, after having endorsed it.If you do not purchase a new vehicle, you have to turn in the licence plate to the SAAQ.If you do purchase a new vehicle, you must apply to the SAAQ for its registration. If you wish, you can use the same licence plate. Chapter 2The vehicle84 | Driver’s HandbookRULES ABOUT ROAD VEHICLES AND THEIR EQUIPMENT1Mandatory identification numbersRoad vehicles must bear manufacturers’ serial numbers. The numbers manufacturers assign are recorded by the SAAQ. The SAAQ may also assign and affix an identification number.Vehicle owners who find that their vehicle does not bear a serial number must apply to the SAAQ to obtain one.Changing, making illegible, defacing, removing or replacing a vehicle’s serial number is prohibited without prior consent from the SAAQ.Compulsory equipment and accessoriesAll road vehicles must include the features and accessories that the manufacturer is required to include under statutes and regulations in effect in Québec.Buses and minibuses used to carry school children must be equipped with signs at the front and rear that read “ÉCOLIERS” (school children).1. Farm-use vehicles are subject to specific traffic rules and safety standards. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 85If school children are carried in a passenger vehicle, the owner must install one of these signs on the vehicle roof, facing the front and back of the vehicle. The signs must be removed or covered when the vehicle is not being used to provide school transportation.Lights and signalsMake sure that the lights and signals required for your type of vehicle are in good working order and that they have not been soiled or obstructed in such a way as to make them less effective.Road vehiclesAll vehicles other than a motorcycle, moped or motorized scooter travelling on public roads must be equipped at the front with at least two single or twin white headlights, two white or amber parking lights, and two white or amber turn-signal lights.At the rear, all vehicles other than motorcycles, mopeds or motorized scooters, including trailers and semitrailers, must have two red tail lights, two red reflectors (which may be part of the lens), two red brake lights, two red or amber turn-signal lights, a white backup light, and a white licence plate light. They must also have a red parking light and side marker light at the rear and an amber parking light and side marker light at the front on either side.In addition, all vehicles that are 9.1 metres long or more must be equipped with an amber parking light and side marker light on either side, halfway between the front and rear side marker lights.Road vehicles and vehicle combinations that are more than two metres wide must also be equipped with lights, reflectors or flares. Chapter 2The vehicle86 | Driver’s HandbookSpecial rules for vehicles over 2.03 metres wideIn addition to the lights required above, road vehicles and  combinations of road vehicles that are over 2.03 metres wide must have an amber clearance light on either side and three amber identification lights in front, and at the rear, a red clearance light on either side and three red identification lights.Motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scootersMotorcycles, mopeds and scooters must be equipped with at least one white headlight, one red tail light, two white or yellow turn-signal lights at the front, two red or yellow turn-signal lights at the rear and one red brake light at the rear. In addition, motorcycles must have two yellow reflectors at the front and two red reflectors at the rear (one on each side).School busesBuses and minibuses used to carry school children must be equipped with two flashing red lights at the front and rear, two flashing amber lights at the front and rear as well as a mandatory stop signal consisting of a retractable stop sign or retractable arm with a stop sign (ARRÊT) with flashing red lights that works in tandem with the red flashing lights on the vehicle. This stop signal must be installed on the outside near the driver’s seat. These signals and lights must be used while children are boarding or leaving the bus. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 87Flashing and rotating lightsRotating and flashing lights are reserved for certain types of vehicles: ▶Red flashing or rotating lights are reserved for emer-gency vehicles; ▶Blue lights are reserved for police vehicles; ▶Amber lights are reserved for service, equipment, escort, snow removal and road maintenance vehicles as well as  vehicles covered by a special permit (oversize vehicles); ▶Green lights are reserved for emergency vehicles at disaster sites or for indicating a command post.If these lights are installed on unauthorized vehicles, they can be confiscated at the owner’s expense.Fog lightsOptional fog lights must meet prescribed standards and be placed at the front of the vehicle at the same level–never higher–than headlights. Chapter 2The vehicle88 | Driver’s HandbookBrakesRoad vehicles and combinations of road vehicles must be equipped with at least one service brake system that is in good working order and capable of applying sufficient braking power to each load- bearing wheel to stop the vehicle quickly in case of emergency, as well as parking brakes that keep it at a full stop. Trailers with a gross vehicle weight of 1,300 kg or less than half of the net weight of the vehicle towing it are exempt from this requirement.It is an offence to drive a vehicle on which the brake system has been modified or altered in such a way as to reduce its effectiveness.A law enforcement officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the brake system of a road vehicle is defective or out of order may have the vehicle impounded or towed to the nearest suitable place for storage at the owner’s expense until the situation has been rectified.Alteration of seat beltsIt is prohibited to drive a road vehicle in which the seat belt provided for the driver or for the seat occupied by a passenger is missing or has been modified or rendered inoperative. A fine of $200 may be imposed. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 89Air bagsDeactivation of an air bag installed in a motor vehicle is prohibited, except by means of a unit installed by the vehicle manufacturer prior to sale to the initial owner. Where an air bag requires replacement (due to deployment or damage), only new original manufacturer parts may be used. Electronic control modules for air bags and seat belts with a pretensioner also have to be replaced by new parts. Failing that, a fine of $300 to $600 may be imposed.ScreensUse of certain screens in a road vehicle is authorized if you can see the information displayed from the driver’s seat and the conditions for installation and use are compliant.For additional information on this subject or to find out which screens are prohibited in vehicles, refer to the “Road Safety” section of the SAAQ Web site at saaq.gouv.qc.ca.Radar detectorsThe installation or sale of a radar detector for a vehicle is prohibited. Driving a vehicle equipped with such a device is prohibited. A peace officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that a vehicle is equipped with a radar warning device may stop the vehicle for an inspection. If a device is found, the officer is authorized to confiscate it at the owner’s expense, giving the driver a receipt. The device is then turned over to the SAAQ, which may dispose of it after 90 days. Chapter 2The vehicle90 | Driver’s HandbookHornsAll vehicles must be equipped with a horn, which should only be used when necessary.Only emergency vehicles may be equipped with sirens or devices that produce a similar warning sound or with mechanisms for changing traffic lights.Under the Highway Safety Code, law enforcement officers may have an unauthorized siren or similar warning device removed from a vehicle at the owner’s expense. The officer gives the driver a receipt before handing the siren or device over to the SAAQ. This rule does not apply to anti-theft devices installed on vehicles.Exhaust systemYour vehicle’s exhaust system must include all components provided by the manufacturer, such as the manifold, pipes, muffler, supports and fasteners.These parts must all be securely fastened and none of them should have any gas leaks.The sale of a vehicle with a sub-standard exhaust system for use on a public roadway is prohibited.Modifying an exhaust system to make it noisier, suppress it or reduce its effectiveness is also prohibited. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 91Windshields and windowsVehicle windshields and windows must be made of transparent glass and manufactured or treated in such a way as to significantly reduce their risk of shattering or being broken. They must be free of any material that might reduce visibility for the driver.No substance that hinders visibility or darkens the glass may be applied to or sprayed on the windshield. A strip no more than 15 cm wide may, however, be placed along the upper edge of the windshield. Side windows on either side of the driver must let in at least 70% of the light when measured with a photometer.A peace officer can require a driver to clean or clear the windshield or windows of any matter.Rearview mirrorsAll motor vehicles, except for motorcycles, mopeds and scooters, must have at least two securely attached rearview mirrors in good working order: one inside, in the centre of the upper part of the windshield, and one outside the driver’s side.When use of the inside mirror is impossible, an outside mirror (side mirror) must be attached to the right side of the vehicle.Motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scooters must be equipped with a securely attached side mirror on each side.Speedometer and odometerAll motor vehicles (except mopeds, scooters and motorcycles with an engine size up to 125 cc) must be equipped with a speedometer and odometer in good working order. Chapter 2The vehicle92 | Driver’s HandbookBumpersMotor vehicle bumpers must be securely fixed in their intended location.TiresOwners must ensure that their vehicles are equipped with tires that meet established standards for use on public roadways and that they are in good condition.Using studded tires is permitted from October 15 to May 1 for commercial vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of no more than 3,000 kg as well as for passenger vehicles and taxis, as long as the vehicles are equipped with studded tires at either end of the axle, and if they are equipped with studded tires on the front axle, then they are also so equipped on the rear axle.Winter drivingUnder the Highway Safety Code, from December 1 to March 15, all taxis and passenger vehicles registered in Québec must be equipped with winter tires. This requirement also applies to rental passenger vehicles in Québec.Before leaving, drivers must clear snow and/or ice from the windows, roof and hood of their vehicle. Drivers must also make sure that nothing can come loose and separate from their vehicle (snow, ice, etc.) while driving. It is not only common sense, it is mandatory! Winter tire exemption certificateThe regulation, which comes under the responsibility of Ministère des Transports, makes provisions for certain exemptions and cases for which a certificate authorizing a passenger vehicle or taxi to operate without winter tires may be issued. Q  For information about exemptions and cases where a certificate can be issued,  consult the Ministère des Transports Web site. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 93Fenders and mudguardsMotor vehicles or combinations of road vehicles that are not fitted with permanent mudguards that are at least as wide as the tread of the tires or whose bottom edge of the rear portion is no more than 350 mm from the ground when the vehicle is not loaded must be equipped with detachable mudguards of resistant material that are at least as wide as the tread of the tires or whose bottom edge of the rear portion is no more than 350 mm from the ground when the vehicle is not loaded. Farm tractors and agricultural machinery manufactured without fenders are not covered by this rule.Natural gas and propane vehiclesNatural gas or propane vehicles must carry a compliance sticker  certifying that the vehicle’s fuel system meets the requirements of the Regulation respecting safety standards for road vehicles. Inspections must be carried out every five years. The sticker must be affixed by a mechanic with the proper certificate of qualification, on a vehicle running on propane or natural gas, whether since its manufacture or following a conversion. Failing to comply with this requirement renders a vehicle owner liable to a $300 to $600 fine.Modifying a vehicleExcept with prior authorization by the SAAQ, no one may alter the frame, body or mechanisms of a vehicle intended for use on a public way if the alteration might decrease vehicle stability or braking effectiveness.The SAAQ’s approval is also required before making an alteration that would change the vehicle type. Chapter 2The vehicle94 | Driver’s HandbookMECHANICAL  INSPECTIONThe SAAQ has exclusive authority over mechanical inspection of road vehicles and the issue of inspection certificates and compliance stickers.Every year, the SAAQ inspects thousands of vehicles stopped by peace officers.Accredited agents located throughout Québec carry out mechanical inspections. Agents are businesses accredited by the SAAQ to carry out inspections of light vehicles (gross vehicle weight rating under 4,500 kg) or heavy vehicles (gross vehicle weight rating of 4,500 kg or more), for a fee. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 95A law enforcement officer may require a mechanical inspection if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a vehicle has been modified or constitutes a public danger. Officers may also impound a vehicle at the owner’s expense, so that an inspection can be carried out.Mandatory Mechanical InspectionVehicles CoveredThe following road vehicles must undergo mechanical inspections at least once a year (every 12 months): ▶Taxis ▶Motorcycles and scooters used by a driving school (including motorcycles and scooters registered for off-road use) ▶Emergency vehicles ▶Vehicles with a GVWR of 4,500 kg or more  ▶Tow trucks with a GVWR of less than 4,500 kg. The following road vehicles must undergo mechanical inspections at least once every 6 months: ▶Vehicles used by a driving school, other than motorcycles and scooters ▶Vehicles used to transport school children, including taxis ▶Buses and minibusesVehicles Exempt  ▶Vehicles with a net mass of 4,000 kg or less that originally had an open truck box and a tailgate and that are registered as passenger vehicles within the meaning of the Regulation respecting road vehicle registration ▶Combinations of road vehicles where each vehicle that is part of the combination has a GVWR of less than 4,500 kg  ▶Sport utility vehicles with a net mass of 4,000 kg or less ▶Tool vehicles ▶Farm tractors and farm machinery Chapter 2The vehicle96 | Driver’s Handbook ▶Construction and farm trailers ▶Detachable axles ▶Motor homes and house trailersLaw enforcement officers may also order a mechanical inspection and set the deadline for the inspection if they have reasonable grounds to believe that a vehicle has undergone changes or is in a condition that constitutes a danger.Inspection outcomeIf the vehicle meets regulatory standards, the SAAQ or its agent issues a certificate of mechanical inspection and a compliance sticker.Where minor repairs are needed, the owner or driver is given 48 hours to make the repairs or have the vehicle repaired. After 48 hours, the vehicle cannot be put back on the road if it has not been repaired or if compliance has not been proven to the SAAQ.A vehicle that requires major repairs cannot be used on the road until it is shown to meet regulatory standards.Furthermore, an owner who refuses or fails to submit a vehicle for mechanical inspection or who refuses to produce a certificate of mechanical inspection will not be allowed to drive the vehicle. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 97DOING YOUR OWN  INSPECTIONThe vehicle equipment and features required for safe driving must always be kept in good working order.Taking note of any odd sounds or other problems with your vehicle is a simple way of saving time and money and avoiding major head-aches later. When carrying out your regular inspections, pay special attention to the following items:BrakesAre they noisy? Does your brake pedal respond immediately to pressure? Can you hear metal surfaces rubbing together? Does your vehicle pull to the left or right when you brake, or stop slowly even when you press down hard on the brake pedal?Parking brakeDoes it hold your vehicle stationary when you are starting the engine or on a slope?Rearview mirrorsAre the rearview and side mirrors securely attached? Are they cracked, chipped or tarnished so that they adversely affect visibility?Are your mirrors adjusted properly, so that you can see well? Chapter 2The vehicle98 | Driver’s HandbookSteeringIs there uneven wear on the front tires? Have you noticed too much play in the steering–a definite tendency for the vehicle to pull to the right or left? Have you had any trouble handling the vehicle? All these things are signs that your steering system should be checked and carefully adjusted. Have your wheel alignment checked at least once a year, and any time you think it might have been jolted out of line.Windshield wipersWhat is the condition of your windshield wipers and your washer fluid distributor? Do they guarantee clear visibility at all times? Did you know that defective windshield wipers can damage your windshield?TiresCheck your tires regularly. Is there uneven or abnormal tire wear? Could this be caused by improper air pressure, infrequent tire rota-tion, or poor alignment or wheel balance?Exhaust systemHave you noticed any leaks in your muffler or exhaust system? You can usually hear them: louder-than-usual engine noise often indicates a problem with the exhaust system. Chapter 2The vehicle2Driver’s Handbook | 99Lights and headlightsAre all lights in good condition and free of matter?Seat beltsHave you examined your seat belt for any cuts or tears in the fabric? Are the belt buckle and locking and unlocking mechanism present and in good working order?HeadrestsIf your vehicle is equipped with a manufacturer-installed headrest, is it still in place and in good condition? Is the middle of the headrest at eye level or level with the top of your ears? Is it near your head, i.e. no further away than seven centimetres?Drive beltsDid you know that drive belts must be in good condition for your own safety? If the belt gives way suddenly in a vehicle with power steering, it will be difficult and even dangerous to drive.Is the tension right? Check to make sure that belts are not cracked and that the fabric is not frayed or torn. Chapter 2The vehicle100 | Driver’s HandbookShock absorbersDoes your vehicle rock after going over a bump or coming out of a pothole? Is it very sensitive to cross-winds? Maybe your shock absorbers are defective.To check them, push down hard on one corner of your vehicle and release. If the corner bounces more than once before resuming its initial position, the shock absorber is probably faulty. Repeat for each corner of the vehicle.Body conditionAre the various pieces of bodywork solidly attached? Be sure to note any holes in the floor, in particular in the trunk, because they can allow toxic gases from the exhaust to infiltrate the cab of the vehicule. 3ROAD SIGNS AND TRAFFIC SIGNALSCHAPTER 3 Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals102 | Driver’s HandbookUnder the Highway Safety Code, road signs and traffic signals must meet the standards set by Ministère des Transports. These signs and signals are designed to ensure the safety of road users, facilitate the flow of traffic and guide road users.However, road signs and traffic signals are not guarantees against the risks inherent in road use. Roadways, vehicles and rules are mainly developed for ideal traffic conditions, but because traffic risks are numerous, drivers must continually adjust their conduct.Québec road signs and traffic signals include road signs, signal lights, and pavement markings. The signs are a visual language that all road users must know and understand for their own safety and the safety of others. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 103SIGNAL LIGHTSSignal lights include all the lights that guide road users. Apart from standard traffic lights, there are flashing lights, pedestrian lights, lights for cyclists, lane use lights, railway crossing lights, parking regulation lights, work site lights, priority lights for buses and inspection station lights.Traffic lightsTraffic lights are generally located at intersections and used to regulate the right of way of vehicles and pedestrians based on the flow of traffic. When traffic lights are defective or not in operation, you must act as though the intersection were controlled by stop signs for all directions, except where an adequate sign or signal replaces the lights.Red lightA red light means you have to stop. Motorists and cyclists are required to bring their vehicle to a full stop at the intersection, before the pedestrian crosswalk or stop line. If there is no line, stop before the edge of the roadway you are preparing to cross. Motorists or cyclists may only proceed on the authorization of a traffic signal. If there are no pedestrian lights, pedestrians must also stop. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals104 | Driver’s HandbookYellow (amber) lightA yellow light means that the light will soon turn red, and indicates to motorists and cyclists that they have to stop before the pedes-trian crosswalk or stop line. If there is no line, stop before the edge of the roadway you are preparing to cross, unless you are already in the intersection or are so close to it that you cannot stop safely. Motorists or cyclists may only proceed on the authorization of a traffic signal. If there are no pedestrian lights, pedestrians have to follow the same rules.Green lightMotorists and cyclists facing a solid or flashing green light may continue on their way after yielding the right of way to vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians already in the intersection. Pedestrians facing a green traffic light may cross the roadway if there are no pedestrian lights.A flashing green light indicates that left turns are protected, meaning that oncoming vehicles are stopped.Red arrowA red arrow prohibits drivers from going in the direction to which it points.Yellow arrowA yellow arrow has the same function as the yellow light, but shows the direction of traffic. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 105Green arrowA green arrow, whether flashing or not, indicates to motorists and cyclists that they must proceed in the direction indicated while following the same rules governing the right of way as those for a green light.Flashing lightsFlashing yellow or red lights are used as additional signals to indicate a particularly dangerous intersection.Flashing red lightMotorists and cyclists approaching a flashing red light must come to a stop and yield the right of way to any vehicle entering the intersection or near enough to it on the intersecting roadway that to proceed might cause an accident. Flashing red lights are used along with stop signs.Flashing yellow lightA flashing yellow light means that motorists and cyclists must slow down and proceed after yielding the right of way to other road users already in the intersection.Flashing yellow lights accompanying regulatory or warning signs are used to direct attention to danger or an obligation. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals106 | Driver’s HandbookPedestrian lightsPedestrian lights regulate pedestrian movement and help pedestrians avoid conflicts with road vehicles.There are two types of pedestrian lights: standard lights and  countdown lights.Standard lights consist of two lamps, one showing the outline of a walking person and the other showing an orange hand. Countdown lights have a third lamp that shows how much time is left.Pedestrian silhouetteThe pedestrian silhouette means that pedestrians may cross the roadway in the area reserved for them. At certain intersections, an audio signal for the visually impaired will sound continuously while the silhouette is lit. When the silhouette starts flashing, the audio signal begins beeping and pedestrians already in the intersection must hurry to reach the sidewalk or median.Orange handThe hand warns pedestrians not to enter the inter-section. When the hand begins to flash, pedestrians already in the intersection must hurry to reach the sidewalk or median. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 107Time counterThe time counter shows the time remaining for pedestrians to cross the intersection.Cyclist lightsCyclist lights, used to regulate bicycle traffic, are made up of three vertical lights in the form of red, yellow and green bicycles. The colours of the bicycles have the same meaning as traffic lights.Lane use lightsLane use lights consist of a red light in the shape of an X, a green light in the shape of a downward arrow and a yellow flashing light in the shape of a horizontal arrow. These lights are mounted over one or several lanes to indicate whether vehicle traffic is permitted or prohibited in the lanes. The meaning of the symbols is as follows:Red XYou may not drive or stop in the lane under this signal. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals108 | Driver’s HandbookDownward green arrowYou may use the lane under this signal.Horizontal yellow arrowThe yellow arrow usually appears in combination with the red X; it indicates that you must, with caution, change lanes either to the left or right because of lane closure ahead.Railway crossing signalsThese warning devices, consisting of flashing red lights, are placed where a roadway and a railway intersect. When they are activated, they indicate to motorists and pedestrians that a train is coming and that they must stop before the level crossing.Regulated parking lightsRegulated parking lights are made up of orange lights accompanied by a regulatory sign. These signs restrict parking on the street at certain times to facilitate road maintenance. The regulation on the sign is in effect only when the lights are on. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 109Work site lightsWork site lights warn road users of areas where road maintenance or repairs are being carried out. You must slow down and be cautious when nearing the work area.Rotating lightsA flashing or rotating yellow light on a vehicle indicates one of the following possibilities: ▶The vehicle could hinder traffic; ▶The vehicle might travel much slower than the maximum speed limit or slower than the minimum speed limit; ▶The vehicle could be accompanying another vehicle which might hinder traffic.Signal arrowsAn arrow affixed to a vehicle or trailer indicates that one lane of traffic is obstructed and that you must take the lane which remains open. The direction of the arrow indicates the lane to use. A double arrow indicates that traffic can go either to the left or right of the obstructed lane. To indicate the presence of a work site along a road with one lane of traffic in each direction or a work site on the road shoulder, only the centre bar of the signal arrow is lit. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals110 | Driver’s HandbookAccompanying vehicleAn accompanying vehicle precedes mobile or very short-term construction sites. This vehicle is mounted with a sign and travels with the work area to indi-cate in advance the proximity of a work area or the manoeuvres to get around the area.Temporary road work lightsTemporary lights may be placed near a work area to control traffic when motorists must use one lane alternately for travel in opposite directions.Bus priority lightsBus priority lights are added to traffic lights to protect the movement of buses so they can more easily merge with the flow of traffic. Bus priority lights are added to traffic lights to protect the movement of buses so they can more easily merge with the flow of traffic. These lights consist of a white bar, triangle or BUS text shining through a black lens. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 111These lights indicate to bus drivers the manoeuvres that are autho-rized and prohibited:White vertical barOnly straight through  movement is authorized. Left and right turn movements are prohibited.White bar slanted to the left Only the left turn manoeuvre is permitted. White bar slanted to the right Only the right turn manoeuvre is permitted.White horizontal bar All priority manoeuvres for buses are prohibited.White triangle Indicates that bus drivers are allowed a clearance inter-val on the same principle as the yellow signal for vehicle  movements.BUSManoeuvres in all directions are permitted. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals112 | Driver’s HandbookInspection station lightsThese lights are placed only in inspection areas. The colour and symbol on the signal light indicate necessary actions to heavy vehicle drivers. ▶Red light: stop for weighing; ▶Upward yellow light: advance slowly; ▶Yellow light pointing right: enter the weigh station and park the vehicle for inspection; ▶Downward yellow arrow: back up slowly; ▶Green light: weighing complete,  departure permitted.PAVEMENT MARKINGSPavement markings are used to show the separation of traffic lanes, indicate the lanes to be used by certain types of vehicles or road users and the movements that are authorized. They supplement road signs and traffic signals.Purpose of pavement markingsPavement markings indicate: ▶The direction of traffic; ▶Traffic lanes; ▶Zones where passing is prohibited; ▶The edge of the roadway and dangerous roadsides; Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 113 ▶Variations in roadway width; ▶Zones reserved for buses and other heavy vehicles; ▶Edges of intersections; ▶Stop lines; ▶Pedestrian, school and playground crosswalks; ▶Parking areas; ▶Commercial service areas; ▶Special manoeuvres as indicated by arrows; ▶Obstructions on or next to the road ahead; ▶Reversible lanes; ▶Bikeways; ▶Reserved lanes; ▶Two-way left-turn lanes; ▶Runaway lanes.Colour of pavement markingsTwo colours, yellow and white, are used to differentiate the function of pavement markings.Yellow markings: ▶Separate traffic lanes in opposite directions; ▶Indicate the left side of the road on divided roadways,  highways  and one-way roadways; ▶Indicate the left edge of a ramp on highways; ▶Indicate areas where parking is prohibited; Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals114 | Driver’s Handbook ▶Indicate areas where children, pedestrians and students must cross between intersections or intersections for which there is no traffic light or stop sign; ▶Indicate the edges of the roadway for better visibility; ▶Separate reversible lanes; ▶Indicate two-way left-turn lanes; ▶Indicate lanes reserved for oncoming or alternate traffic.White markings: ▶Separate traffic lanes on a one-way roadway; ▶Indicate the acceleration and deceleration lanes on a highway; ▶Indicate the right side of divided roadways; ▶Indicate the far sides of two-way roadways; ▶Indicate parking areas; ▶Indicate areas where pedestrians, children and students must cross at intersections for which there are traffic lights or stop signs; ▶Guide turning manoeuvres at intersections; ▶Specify where vehicles must stop; ▶Indicate lanes reserved for traffic in the same direction. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 115Lines, arrows and symbolsWhite or yellow lines, as well as arrows and other symbols, are painted on roadways to remind you of certain rights, obligations and restrictions. Each type and colour of line has a particular meaning.Broken and solid single linesBroken and solid single lines divide traffic lanes. The lines are white when separating one-way traffic lanes and yellow when separating two-way traffic lanes.You may cross a broken line under certain circumstances but not a solid line. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals116 | Driver’s HandbookSolid double linesTwo solid yellow lines next to one another separate two-way traffic lanes. They may not be crossed.Combined linesA solid yellow line alongside a broken yellow line also separates two-way traffic. You may cross these lines under certain circumstances, if the broken line is on your side.White combined lines may also separate one-way traffic lanes. You may cross these lines only if the broken line is on your side.Lane linesLines that separate lanes of traffic in the same direction are  generally white and broken; however, in order to limit or prohibit lane changes, the lines may be solid, single, double, or combined, such as at the approach of another roadway or in a tunnel.Reversible laneParallel yellow broken lines mark a lane on either side in urban areas where the direction of traffic alternates. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 117Two-way left-turn laneIn some cases, an additional lane is designed to facilitate left turns by traffic in both directions. This lane is located in the middle of the roadway and is marked on either side by parallel yellow lines, one solid and one broken. Yellow lane selection arrows also mark the pavement to clearly indicate that only a left turn is allowed from the lane.Reserved lanePavement markings for a lane that is reserved at all times are double solid lines, while those marking a reserved lane for certain hours are double broken lines. Diagonal broken white lines on the pavement in the reserved lane  indicate to drivers in the adjacent lane that shared use of the lane is allowed on the condition they turn at the next intersection.Slow-moving vehicle laneAn additional lane for slow-moving vehicles is set aside in places where the grade or length of a slope causes some heavy vehicles to slow considerably. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals118 | Driver’s HandbookStop lineThe white stop line is painted across the roadway, perpendicular to an intersection with traffic lights or a stop sign. It indicates the point at which a vehicle must stop.Pedestrian crosswalkAt intersections with traffic lights or stop signs, two parallel solid white lines or a “zebra crossing” painted on the roadway indicate the area where pedestrians must cross. Elsewhere, pedestrian crosswalks are indicated by yellow pavement markings.Parking areasWhite lines on the pavement identify areas where parking is allowed; yellow lines indicate that parking is prohibited.WheelchairA white wheelchair symbol indicates parking spaces or access ramps designed for persons with physical disabilities. It is accompanied by a regulatory parking sign on parking spaces indicating that these parking spaces are reserved exclusively for physically disabled individuals who have a disabled parking permit. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 119Bus stop zoneStop zones for city buses are marked by a rectangle with a yellow zigzag pattern. The left side of the rectangle is marked with a white broken line.Vehicle sensorThis symbol is painted on the pave-ment to highlight the presence of vehicle sensors and help you stop your vehicle at the desig-nated place for the mechanism to transmit a signal to traffic lights. The symbol is placed on the centre of the sensor and is designed to reduce waiting times at intersections.Aircraft patrolledYellow equilateral triangles on the pavement or shoulder identify areas where traffic is subject to surveillance from aircraft. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals120 | Driver’s HandbookArrows and symbolsWhite arrows may be painted on the roadway. They indicate lane direction.An elongated white diamond on pavement  indicates a lane reserved for certain types of vehicles.A bicycle symbol painted on the roadway indicates a bikeway.ROAD SIGNSRoad signs use pictograms and instructions to ensure road users’ safety and facilitate the flow of trafficIn many instances, smaller tabs are attached to signs to specify the message conveyed by the road sign.There are four types of road signs:Regulatory signsRegulatory signs indicate your obligations and the restrictions placed upon you by the Highway Safety Code. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 121Warning signsWarning signs draw attention to road sections where you must be particularly cautious due to obstacles or hazards on or alongside the roadway. The signs warn drivers to slow down, stop or change directions.Information signsInformation signs provide simple indications about destinations: distance, direction, street name, point of interest, service or information.Road work signsRoad work signs signal construction or maintenance being carried out on or alongside a roadway and provide useful indications on how to get through the work area safely. Road work signs can either be regulatory signs, warning signs or information signs.Shapes and colours of the main types of signsThe message conveyed by a road sign depends on the shape, colour and alphanumerical information or symbol used.The choice of colour is based on North American conventions. In general, the following colours are used to distinguish between the different categories of signs:Black and white: regulatory signs Yellow: danger warnings Orange: road work Green, brown or blue: information signs  Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals122 | Driver’s HandbookThe shape of a sign may sometimes identify its category. For  example, danger and work site signs are diamond shaped. In addition, some shapes are reserved for particular signs. For example, octagons are reserved for stop signs and pentagons are reserved to identify school zones.Regulatory, warning and road work signs convey their messages using arrows and symbols, whereas information signs bear  written information.CategoryShapeColourCommentsRegulatoryRedReserved for stop signsRed or whiteReserved for yield signsBlackWhiteBlackReserved for one-way signs Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 123CategoryShapeColourCommentsWarning and road workFluorescent yellow-greenReserved for signs  indicating the  beginning of a school zoneFluorescent yellow-greenReserved for advance school zone or school crossing signsYellowReserved for danger warningsOrangeReserved for work sitesYellowDanger warningsOrangeWork sitesYellowDanger warningsOrangeWork sitesRed and whiteReserved for  warning chevrons Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals124 | Driver’s HandbookCategoryShapeColourCommentsIndicationBlueReserved for highwaysGreenReserved for roadsBlueTourist informationBrownPublic tour-ist attractionsRedEmergency facilitiesGreenHighways, roads and bikewaysGreenHighways, roads and bikewaysBluePrivate tourist  facilities and services off highwaysBrownPublic tourist attractions  and points of interestYellowReserved for highway  exits Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 125PictogramsPictograms such as symbols, arrows and silhouettes are used to replace words in order to make road signs easier to understand.ArrowsArrows are used to indicate areas controlled by regulation, to announce upcoming signs, and to indicate clearances, lanes to follow or use, detours, manoeuvres and destinations.SilhouettesSilhouettes indicate the people and things affected by the sign. They indicate specific configurations, encourage road users to be particularly careful, and convey information.Prohibition symbolThis symbol, a red circle with a red diagonal bar, indicates that anything within the circle is prohibited.Mandatory symbolThis symbol, a green circle, indicates that anything within the circle is compulsory. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals126 | Driver’s HandbookIdentification and meaning of road signs and traffic signalsRegulatory signsStopIndicates that you must come to a full stop at an intersection.All-way stop: this sign, placed below stop signs at intersections, tells users coming from all direc-tions that they must come to a full stop. The shape on the sign shows the layout of the  intersection (+, T, Y).Do not enterAccess to a roadway or traffic lane is prohibited for all types of vehicles because entry could result in a head-on collision.This tab accompanies the “Do not enter” sign and specifies its meaning. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals3Driver’s Handbook | 127YieldYield the right of way to vehicles travelling on the road you are about to enter.Traffic circle yieldYield the right of way to vehicles that are travelling in the traffic circle you are about to enter.When encountering these signs, some drivers believe they can continue driving without slowing down. Other drivers systematically come to a full stop. Both disrupt the flow of traffic. The goal is to merge with traffic without stopping, and without hampering the progress of those who are already in the circle. You should only stop when it is impossible to do otherwise.Yield the right of way to oncoming vehicles. This sign is used at work sites where no flagperson is available, in places where a single lane is available for vehicles travelling in both directions and on some narrow bridges.Stop lineLine on the roadway at which vehicles must stop.

The sign indicates whether the bike-way is open to another sport in the winter.Signs for cyclistsCyclists can ride on the majority of roads in Québec, with the exception of highways. Drivers must therefore exercise caution when they see cyclists on the side of the road. There are four types of infrastructures intended to make cycling safer: paved shoulders, shared roadways, bike lanes, and bike paths.Paved shoulders, marked off with a solid white line, allow cyclists to ride in the direction of traffic, alongside motor vehicles.Bike lanes in urban areas occupy part of the roadway, but are marked off or physically separated from traffic lanes and reserved exclusively for cyclists.Shared roadways are usually found where motor vehicle traffic is light and slow moving. There are no protected corridors, merely signs. Chapter 3Road Signs and Traffic Signals204 | Driver’s HandbookBike paths are designed exclusively for the use of cyclists, often away from motor vehicle traffic.As with motor vehicles, signs for cyclists come in four types: regula-tory, warning, work site and information signs.NB: The signs presented in this section are the ones that do not appear in any other section.Regulatory signsBicycle tabDraws the attention of cyclists to any regulatory sign concerning them only, meaning that it is not addressed to other road users.Mandatory route for cyclists and pedestriansRoute cyclists must take.Respective side of the shared lane cyclists and pedestrians must use.Cyclists and pedestrians must share the portion of the roadway; there is no exclusive corridor for either.

Pedestrians, motorcyclists, moped or motorized scooter opertors and cyclists also have certain rights and obligations when using a public roadway. For safety’s sake, it is important to know these rules and follow them. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 215PROTECTIONSeat beltsSeat belts are not simply an accessory. They are an important safety feature that can save lives, and wearing one is mandatory.All occupants sitting in the front or back seat of a moving motor vehicle, with the exception of children whose sitting height is less than 63 cm (starting on April 18, 2019, children must be at least 145 cm tall or 9 years old), must wear and properly fasten the seat belt provided. Driving a road vehicle is prohibited if the driver or passenger seat belt is missing, unusable or has been altered. If you are driving, you are also responsible for making sure that passengers under age 16 are wearing their seat belt properly.As stated above, a child whose sitting height is less than 63 cm, measured from the seat to the top of the head, must be placed in a restraint system or booster seat in compliance with the applicable regulations of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act. However, as of April 18, 2019, a new measure will be in effect, and children who are 145 cm tall or less or under 9 years old must be secured in a car seat suitable for their weight and height. The restraint system or booster seat must, in accordance with the accompanying manufacturer’s instructions, be suited to the child’s weight and height, and be properly installed in the vehicle. This obligation does not apply in taxis or police vehicles, in which case the child must be restrained by the seat belt available. Chapter 4Traffic Rules216 | Driver’s HandbookHowever, the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) may, for exceptional medical reasons, issue a certificate exempting a person from wearing or partially wearing a seat belt or authorizing them, in particular, to add devices to the seat belt or vehicle seat.Taxi drivers operating a vehicle as part of their job on a public  roadway with a speed limit set by a municipality or on an unnumbered roadway are also exempt from the obligation to wear a seat belt.You are not required to wear a seat belt when backing up or when riding in a passenger seat of a police wagon.Air bagsAir bags are proven safety devices. Front air bags are designed to prevent the occupants of a vehicle from striking their head, neck or chest against the dashboard, steering wheel or windshield in a head-on collision. They also provide effective protection against potentially fatal or disabling injuries. We know that the combined use of air bags and seat belts reduces the risk of severe head injury by 75% and severe chest injury by 66%.Other types of air bags exist, such as curtain air bags, side air bags, knee air bags or inflatable seat belts. These devices are designed to increase the safety of occupants in various types of accidents (head-on or side collisions and rollovers).Air bags are deployed by an electronic command module that activates them only if the accident is serious enough. Air bags contain tiny holes, which enable them to deflate upon absorbing the momentum from the occupant. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 217Some measures should be taken to reduce risks during air bag  deployment: ▶Infants must always be seated in a rear-facing infant safety seat that is secured to the back seat (in the middle, vehicle permitting); ▶Children age 12 and under must always be seated in the back seat and, where required, in a seat that is suited to their weight and height, and secured to the back seat; ▶Always wear a seat belt; ▶Move the driver’s seat back to ensure that there is a distance of at least 25 cm between the centre of the air bag cover and the middle of your chest area.The SAAQ may authorize an air bag to be deactivated if one of the drivers of a vehicle or a passenger is at risk when an air bag deploys. Applications should be filed using the Declaration of Requirement for Air Bag Deactivation form (available in the E-forms section of the SAAQ Web site at saaq.gouv.qc.ca). Chapter 4Traffic Rules218 | Driver’s HandbookHeadrestsThousands of Quebecers suffer whiplash injuries in automobile  accidents each year. Only 10% of drivers adjust their headrest properly.If your headrest is placed too low, behind the neck, it is of little use because in the event of a rear-end collision, your head will be violently thrust back, causing a neck injury.Maximum protection is provided  when: ▶The distance between the headrest and the back of your head is not greater than seven centimetres; ▶The middle of the headrest is level with your eyes or top of your ears.maximum of 7 cm Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 219TRAFFIC RULESWhether turning, changing lanes, passing or carrying out another manoeuvre, you have to follow particular rules in each case.Traffic lane divisionsSome lines separating traffic lanes may be crossed, while others may not. You may cross a broken line after ensuring that you can do so safely.A broken line next to a solid line means passing is allowed if the broken line is on your side at the start of the manoeuvre. Passing must be completed before the broken line ends. Chapter 4Traffic Rules220 | Driver’s HandbookIn general, you are not allowed to cross a solid single line or solid double line.However, these lines may be crossed if the traffic lane is obstructed or closed, or to make a left turn onto another roadway or into a private driveway. They can also be crossed to pass farm machinery, farm tractors, animal-drawn vehicles, bicycles or vehicles with a slow-moving vehicle warning sign (orange triangle with reflectorized dark red edges).Lane useTwo or more lanes of two-way trafficWhen travelling on a roadway, use the right-hand lane. You may use the left lane, however, to pass another vehicle or to avoid an obstacle after making sure the left lane is free before entering it. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 221Centre left-turn laneOn two-way roadways that have three or five lanes, the centre lane is reserved exclusively for making left turns (both directions). The procedure is to travel in the right-hand lanes and use the centre lane only to turn left. Closed laneIf one or more lanes in the direc-tion you are travelling are closed or obstructed, you may use the nearest free lane intended for oncoming traffic, after yielding the right of way to any vehicle in that lane.Two or three lanes of one-way trafficYou should generally keep to the far right when there are two lanes for traffic in the same direction. Chapter 4Traffic Rules222 | Driver’s HandbookWhen there are three lanes, you should generally use one of the right-hand lanes.Particular circumstances: ▶On highways, you may use the far left lane to pass other vehi-cles, turn left, avoid obstacles, or move toward an exit lane. ▶Slowing down in the left-hand lane is permitted, as long as you signal your intention to turn left or stop on the left side of the lane. ▶However, when the speed limit is below 80 km/h, for instance on an urban boulevard, you may use either lane. Travelling faster than a vehicle in another lane is not considered passing.Roadway separated by a median or other dividerDo not cross medians or other dividers separating traffic lanes, except in those places indicated by the appropriate signs.Highway access and exit rampsTo enter or exit a highway, use designated access and exit lanes.IntersectionsIn intersections, the risk of danger or an accident is high. This is the reason why it is prohibited to come to a stop, block a lane or change lanes in an intersection. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 223Speed limits and distance between vehiclesAny action or speed likely to endanger people’s lives or safety or property is prohibited. These obligations apply on all public road-ways and on private roadways open to public road vehicle traffic and on land occupied by shopping centres or other land where public traffic is allowed.Obey the following speed limits: ▶On highways: ▷60 km/h minimum; ▷100 km/h maximum. ▶On roads with a concrete or asphalt surface: ▷90 km/h maximum. ▶On gravel roads: ▷70 km/h maximum. ▶In a school zone: ▷50 km/h maximum unless a sign indicates a different speed, which you must obey. ▶In cities, towns or villages, unless otherwise indicated: ▷50 km/h maximum.Reduce speed when travelling after dark, in fog, rain, snow or other conditions that limit visibility, as well as on a road surface that is slippery or not entirely cleared. You must also slow down when approaching road construction.However, it is prohibited to travel so slowly as to hinder the flow of traffic. Chapter 4Traffic Rules224 | Driver’s HandbookDistance between vehiclesWhen travelling behind another vehicle, maintain a reasonable, safe distance from the vehicle ahead so that you can stop without causing an accident if you need to brake quickly. Take into account traffic speed, traffic density, weather conditions and the state of the road surface. The “two-second rule” can be used to estimate the distance between two vehicles. This rule is described and illustrated in the publications on driving techniques: Driving a Passenger Vehicle, Operating a Motorcycle, and Operating a Moped or Scooter.If you are travelling in a convoy on a public roadway where the maximum speed is 70 km/h or higher, leave sufficient space between the vehicles and allow other drivers to pass you.PassingSeveral situations may call for passing another vehicle. You have to follow certain rules when doing so.Before passing another vehicle: ▶Make sure passing is allowed (broken lines between lanes); ▶Make sure that the left lane is free and that no other vehicle coming from behind is going to occupy that lane; ▶Make sure that the lane you wish to enter is unoccupied for a sufficient distance; ▶Signal your intention to pass using turn-signal lights. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 225Passing should be avoided when travelling in fog or in conditions with decreased visibility.Use the left lane to pass. A passing vehicle must return to the right-hand lane once the manoeuvre is complete.Passing a bicycleIf you want to pass a bicycle, you must leave a distance of: ▶1 m on a road of 50 km/h or less; ▶1.5 m on a road of over 50 km/h.If there is not enough room to perform the manoeuvre, you must stay in your lane, reduce your speed and wait behind the cyclist until there is an opportunity to pass.Passing a pedestrianIf you meet an oncoming pedestrian or wish to pass a pedestrian walking on the roadway or the shoulder, you must leave a distance of: ▶1 m on a road of 50 km/h or less; ▶1.5 m on a road of over 50 km/h.Being passedIf you are being passed or about to be passed by another vehicule, do not accelerate. You could slow down out of courtesy to make it easier. Chapter 4Traffic Rules226 | Driver’s HandbookPassing prohibitedIf you need to use a lane reserved for oncoming traffic in order to pass, avoid doing so: ▶When approaching or on top of a hill; ▶In a curve; ▶When approaching or  crossing a marked pedestrian cross-walk, a level crossing or a tunnel; ▶Any other place where signs or pavement markings indicate that passing is prohibited.In all these situations, vehicle 1 may not pass vehicle 2.2121 Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 227Passing is also prohibited when there are vehicles in the left lane, or if a vehicle behind has signaled the intention to pass, or has begun to do so. In situations like those illustrated below, the driver of vehicle 1 may not pass vehicle 2..When driving on a road way with two or more lanes of one-way traffic, avoid: ▶Weaving in and out of traffic; ▶Passing on the right, except: ▷When passing a vehicle making a left turn or heading toward  a highway exit ramp; ▷When passing a vehicle performing maintenance in the left lane.At no time may your vehicle leave the roadway (for example, driving on the shoulder) to pass.2121 Chapter 4Traffic Rules228 | Driver’s HandbookPassing in a slow laneWhen signs indicate a far right-hand lane for slow-moving vehicles, drivers travelling slowly must use it. Slow lanes, created to maintain traffic flow, are usually found in mountainous areas. Any vehicle can use them–not just trucks.Since some of these lanes are longer than two kilometres, a broken line may be used over a certain distance to allow vehicles driving downhill to pass other vehicles.If you are travelling in the slow lane on the right-hand side, you are prohibited from re-entering the main lane if a solid line is painted on the pavement.TurningBefore making a turn at an intersection: ▶Make sure the manoeuvre can be performed safely; ▶Signal your intention to turn using turn-signal lights; Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 229 ▶Yield the right of way to pedestrians and cyclists crossing the roadway you are about to enter; ▶Yield the right of way to vehicles travelling on the intersecting roadway, oncoming vehicles, or vehicles approaching or already in the intersection.You must turn as soon as the way is clear. If, when preparing to turn, you are unable to move into the designated turning lane, continue and turn at another intersection.The following illustrations show the rules to follow when making the most common right and left turns.Right turnsTo make a right turn onto a roadway with one or more lanes, whether for one- or two-way traffic: ▶Move to the far right-hand side of the roadway or to the  lane designated for  turning  right; ▶Advance in a straight line to the point where the two roadways meet; ▶Turn sharply and enter the far right-hand lane of the other roadway without encroaching upon the left lane or any bicycle lane or reserved lane. Chapter 4Traffic Rules230 | Driver’s HandbookLeft turnsTo make a left turn at the intersection of roadways with two-way traffic: ▶Stay in the centre of the lane in which you are travelling; ▶Advance in a straight line to the point where the two roadways meet; ▶As soon as the way is clear, turn into the nearest lane (furthest to the left) for the direction you want to travel. ▶Move over to the left lane or a to a lane designated for turning left; ▶Advance in a straight line to the point where the two roadways meet; ▶As soon as the way is clear, turn into the nearest lane (furthest to the left) for the direction you want to travel. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 231When turning from a road with two-way traffic onto a one-way road: ▶Move over to the left lane or a designated turning lane; ▶Advance in a straight line to the point where the two roadways meet; ▶As soon as the way is clear, enter the far left lane of the other roadway.When turning from a one-way road onto a road with two-way traffic: ▶Move over to the far left-hand lane or a designated turning lane; ▶Advance in a straight line to the point where the two roadways meet; ▶Turn into the nearest lane (furthest to the left) for the direction you want to travel. Chapter 4Traffic Rules232 | Driver’s HandbookIf there are two designated turn-ing lanes, the turn should be completed in the corresponding lane of the other roadway.When turning from a one-way road onto another one-way road:A. Move over to the far left-hand lane or any other designated turning lane; B. Advance in a straight line to the point where the two roadways meet;C. Turn into the far left lane of the other roadway.CBA Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 233At an intersection where several vehicles are turning at the same timeAt an intersection of two roads with more than one lane in both directions, when these manoeuvres are performed simultaneously by several vehicles, it is essential that each driver direct his or her vehicle into the correct lane.If you are turning right:A. Move into the lane on the  extreme right or into a designated turning lane;B. Advance in a straight line to the point where the two roadways meet;C. Turn sharply and enter the right-hand lane of the other roadway without encroach-ing upon the left lane or any bicycle lane or reserved lane.If you are turning left:D. Move over to the left lane or a designated turning lane;E. Advance in a straight line to the point where the two road-ways meet;F. As soon as the way is clear, turn into the furthest left-hand lane for the direction you want to travel, without encroaching upon the right lane.ABCFE D Chapter 4Traffic Rules234 | Driver’s HandbookTurning right on a red lightTo safely turn right at a red light, motorists must follow these steps: 1. Stop: ▶Come to a complete stop at the stop line or before the pedes-trian crossing. Be careful not to block the pedestrian crossing.2. Look twice: ▶Make sure that turning right on the red light is allowed; ▶If there is no prohibiting sign, or outside of the time period indicated on the tab accompanying a prohibiting sign, or outside the island of Montréal, make sure that turning right on the red light can be done safely: ▷Yield the right of way to pedestrians and cyclists in the intersection or about to enter it. Pedestrians always have the right of way when facing a green traffic light or a pedestrian light allowing them to cross; ▷Look left, ahead and right (mirror and blind spot) and look left again; ▷Yield to vehicles so as to not impede traffic; ▶Be extra careful in the presence of children, the elderly, people with reduced mobility or anyone crossing slowly.3. Decide: ▶Turning right on a red light is not mandatory. It should be done only if the way is clear. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 235Traffic circlesA traffic circle is a roadway configuration that contains one to three lanes and encompasses a central island. Traffic flows counterclockwise. Basic principles 1. You always enter a traffic circle from the right.2. You must yield the right of way to drivers who are already  travelling in the circle. 3. If there is a pedestrian crosswalk, you must yield them the right of way. How to drive through a traffic circleTo drive through a traffic circle, you must:1. Reduce your speed Slow down as you approach the traffic circle and observe the signs. Be prepared to come to a complete stop:  ▷If a pedestrian is crossing or about to do so; ▷If a vehicle is already in the traffic circle, to the left. 2. Yield the right of way Before entering, yield to vehicles that are already in the traffic circle, as they have the right of way.3. Enter from the right  Enter the traffic circle when it is safe to do so.4. Travel in the same direction as traffic  Do not pass other vehicles or stop unless in the case of an emergency, such as to avoid a collision.5. When exiting the traffic circle: ▷Signal your intention using your turn signals; ▷Exit the traffic circle (watch for pedestrians). Chapter 4Traffic Rules236 | Driver’s HandbookIndicating your intentions and presenceSignalling your intentionsBefore changing lanes, making a U-turn (unless prohibited by a road sign), passing, turning or entering a roadway from the shoulder or a parking area, indicate your intentions using the vehicle’s turn-signal lights continuously over a sufficient distance to ensure your safety and that of other road users.Using hazard lightsIf you have to drive very slowly, use your vehicle’s hazard lights. Hazard lights should only be used for reasons of safety (such as a broken-down or stalled vehicle on the roadway at night).Using headlights and running lightsAt night or in poor weather conditions, make sure that your vehicle’s headlights and running lights are on.At night, switch from high beams to low beams: ▶When coming within 150 metres of an oncoming vehicle; ▶When coming within 150 metres of the vehicle ahead; ▶When the roadway is sufficiently well lit. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 237Yielding the right of wayThe Highway Safety Code describes many situations where road users must yield the right of way.In the presence of pedestriansDrivers must yield the right of way to pedestrians crossing or  preparing to cross: ▶At a green light; ▶At a pedestrian light (white), flashing or not; ▶At an intersection regulated by one or several stop signs; ▶At an intersection regulated by a yield sign.At a pedestrian crosswalkDrivers must yield the right of way to pedestrians who are crossing or clearly signalling their intention to cross the road by: ▶Walking toward the pedestrian crosswalk; ▶Waiting at a pedestrian crosswalk; ▶Making eye contact with the driver; ▶Gesturing with their hand.In the presence of a group of cyclistsUnless authorized to do so by a peace officer, drivers cannot pass a group of cyclists travelling on a road with one lane of traffic in each direction. If the group is travelling against oncoming traffic, the driver must slow down and maintain a buffer lane.Drivers can pass a group of cyclists travelling on a road with two or more lanes of traffic in each direction. The driver must first slow down and then move to the other lane heading in the same direction as he or she is travelling, provided this manoeuvre can be made safely and without danger. Chapter 4Traffic Rules238 | Driver’s HandbookYield signsThe driver of vehicle 1 has to yield the right of way to vehicle 2 before entering lane A.Entering a highwayThe driver of vehicle 1 has to merge with the flow of traffic on the highway while yielding the right of way to vehicle 2. In the example illustrated, the driver has to pull in behind vehicle 2.The driver of vehicle 2 must consider that vehicle 1 is trying to merge with traffic on the highway, and should display courtesy and change lanes if possible.21A21 Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 239At a mandatory stopAt an intersection controlled by  a stop sign for one roadway only: Drivers and cyclists required to stop at an intersection or flashing red light must yield the right of way to any vehicle on the other roadway already in the intersection or near enough to the intersection that entering it would be dangerous.At an all-way stop:Drivers and cyclists required to  stop at an intersection regulated by an all-way stop must yield the right of way to any vehi-cle that reaches the intersection before them.In both of these cases, drivers and cyclists are also required to yield the right of way to pedestrians and cyclists crossing or travelling alongside the roadway that they are about to cross or enter. Chapter 4Traffic Rules240 | Driver’s HandbookAt certain traffic lightsAt any of the following traffic lights: ▶Flashing red light; ▶Flashing yellow light; ▶Solid or flashing green light; ▶Green arrow;drivers and cyclists have to yield the right of way to anyone already in the intersection or make sure that they can make it across the intersection safely.Turning at an intersectionDrivers and cyclists are required to: ▶Yield the right of way to pedestrians and cyclists who are  crossing or travelling alongside the roadway that they wish to cross or enter. In the example illustrated, the driver of vehicule 1 yields the right of way to the pedestrian; ▶Yield the right of way, when making a left turn, to any oncoming vehicle. In the  example illustrated,  vehicle 3 yields the right of way to vehicle 2, the  pedestrian and vehicle 1.321 Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 241Entering or exiting private propertyDrivers and cyclists wishing to enter or exit private property should first signal their intentions and then yield the right of way to any vehicle or pedestrian travelling on the public roadway.In this illustration, before entering lane A or B, the driver of vehi-cle 1 has to yield the right of way to the pedestrian, motorcyclist and vehicle 2.In the situation illustrated here, the driver has to yield the right of way to the motorcyclist and pedestrian before entering the private driveway.21ABEntrée privéeEntrée privée Chapter 4Traffic Rules242 | Driver’s HandbookEmergency vehiclesDrivers must yield the right of way to an emergency vehicle whose flashing or rotating lights and/or sirens are activated. Remain calm and provide room for such vehicles to pass, regardless of where they are or which direction they are travelling (oncoming lane, behind you, beside you, etc.).Procedure to follow ▶Reduce your speed; ▶Keep as far to the right as possible; ▶Come to a stop, if necessary.Stay clear of intersections and never turn in front of an emergency vehicle (it is better to backtrack, if necessary) or attempt to follow closely behind one. Adopting good behaviours helps to save lives; every second counts.Interception by a police vehicle If a driver is being followed by a police vehicle whose flashing or rotating lights and/or sirens are activated, the police officer may have observed an offence. Remain calm and follow the required procedure.Procedure to follow ▶Activate your turn signals; ▶Pull over to the side of the road as soon as you can do so safely; ▶Come to a stop; ▶Place your hands on the steering wheel so they are visible.The police officer will inform you of the reason for the interception and ask questions, which you are obligated to answer. Be cooperative. If the interception takes place at night, do not be surprised if the police officer points a flashlight at you and the inside of the vehicle.  Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 243Move-Over LawThe purpose of a Move-Over Law is to ensure the safety of certain workers who must exit their vehicle to perform their tasks. When approaching stopped vehicles with flashing or rotating lights or a yellow arrow signal light, you must:  ▶Reduce your speed; ▶Distance yourself as far as possible from the stopped vehicle after ensuring that you can do so safely; ▶Come to a stop, if necessary.Stopped vehicles that require a Move-Over Law ▶Emergency vehicles: police vehicles, ambulances, fire  department vehicles, Contrôle routier Québec vehicles; ▶Surveillance vehicles equipped with a yellow arrow signal light; ▶Tow trucks.Procedure to followThe procedure is different depending on whether you are travelling on a two-way road or a multi-lane road.  ▶Two-way road ▷Move as closely as possible to the middle line to distance yourself from the workers; ▷Return to the centre of the lane after passing the workers and their vehicles. ▶Multi-lane road  ▷Move over to the left lane after ensuring that you can do so safely; ▷Return to the right lane after passing the workers and their vehicles. Chapter 4Traffic Rules244 | Driver’s HandbookBusesOn public roads with a maximum speed limit under 70 km/h, yield the right of way to a bus whose driver wishes to re-enter the lane the bus occupied before stopping. The bus driver must make sure that it is safe to do so and indicate intentions using the turn-signal lights.School busesDrivers must always be prepared to stop when near a school bus. School buses make frequent stops to pick up and drop off children. To avoid causing other drivers to slow down or accelerate without warning, the school bus driver who intends to stop must warn other drivers by advance signalling a mandatory stop. Remember these two steps: ▶Prepare to stop when the school bus’s flashing amber lights or hazard lights are activated; ▶Come to a complete stop when the bus’s flashing red lights or stop sign are activated.You must come to a stop at least five metres from a school bus when its flashing red lights are activated or its mandatory stop sign is extended. You may proceed when the flashing lights are turned off, the stop sign is retracted and it is safe to advance. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 245This obligation applies to drivers who are travelling on the same roadway as a school bus, regardless of its location (in front of you or on a perpendicular roadway). However, if the roadway is separated by a median or another type of divider, this obligation does not apply.Level crossingsAt a level crossing, drivers and cyclists must stop their vehicle at least five metres from the railway where red flashing lights, a lowered gate or a railway employee signals an approaching rail vehicle.Do not enter a level crossing if there is not enough free space ahead to clear the crossing completely.Unless otherwise indicated, the driver of a bus, minibus or vehicle carrying hazardous material must stop at least five metres from a level crossing at all times and may continue only when they are certain they can cross safely.5 m5 m Chapter 4Traffic Rules246 | Driver’s HandbookBacking upWhen backing up, make sure the manoeuvre can be performed safely and without impeding traffic.Driving in reverse is prohibited on highways and on their access and exit ramps.Shared streetsA shared street is a street on which pedestrians have the right of way. Road vehicles are also authorized to travel on such streets.  ▶The speed limit is 20 km/h. ▶Pedestrians can walk in any direction and cross at any time or location. Bicycle boulevardsA bicycle boulevard is a street on which cyclists have the right of way and can travel along the entire width of the lane. Road vehicles are also authorized to travel on such streets.  ▶The speed limit is 30 km/h. ▶Signs indicate the start and end of a bicycle boulevard. ▶Cyclists can ride side by side, except when travelling against oncoming traffic. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 247Sharing the road with heavy vehiclesAll car, motorcycle and truck drivers have their own reasons for using the road network. Each is required to behave responsibly. Here are a few safety rules that call for courtesy and tolerance when sharing the road with other users.It is important to be aware of the limitations of driving a heavy vehicle in order to have a better understanding of the manoeuvres required of truck drivers and to drive defensively. Since trucks are longer, wider and heavier than other vehicles, they are more difficult to handle and react more slowly.For example, trucks require greater time and distance to stop. If you are travelling in front of a heavy vehicle, signal your intentions to turn or change lanes well ahead of time. Sudden moves such as quickly cutting in front of a heavy vehicle must be avoided at all costs. Plan for the extra time and distance before passing a truck.When a truck driver signals a turn at an intersection, all other  drivers should cooperate by remaining behind and allowing the heavy vehicle to complete the turn without getting in its way.Given the length and height of their vehicles, heavy vehicle drivers have difficulty seeing other road users. There are blind spots at the front, rear and side of the vehicle. For example, if you are travelling behind a truck and do not see any of the truck’s side mirrors, you are too close. You should also avoid travelling alongside a heavy vehicle and taking too much time to pass it, because the driver cannot see you. Chapter 4Traffic Rules248 | Driver’s HandbookHeavy vehicle blind spotsDriving near a heavy vehicle requires you to exercise extra care. Blind spots are those areas of the road that a heavy vehicle driver cannot see because of the vehicle’s size. Drivers cannot see other road users when they are in those areas, and the risk of collision is higher. A heavy vehicle’s blind spots are at the front, rear and sides. For greater road safety, avoid staying in a heavy vehicle’s blind spots and make sure that the driver sees you when you have finished passing.Five situationsIn front of the vehicleA collision may occur when the driver of a light vehicle cuts quickly in front of a heavy vehicle, from the left or right lane and slows down once in front.Behind the vehicleA collision could occur when the driver of a light vehicle is following a heavy vehicle too closely, and the latter stops or slows suddenly. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 249On either side of the vehicleThere are blind spots on either side of a heavy vehicle, because these areas are not covered by the truck’s side mirrors. A collision could occur when a light vehicle is travelling in one of these blind spots and the heavy vehicle moves to the left or right.WHEN NEARING A WORK SITEA series of orange diamond-shaped signs indicate that road work is being carried out further ahead. Work areas may be identified by cones, barrels, barriers, signs, pavement markings, flashing arrows or temporary signal lights.Be particularly careful when nearing a work site and obey the following traffic rules: ▶Be patient. The purpose of road work is to improve  traffic conditions. Some inconvenience to motorists cannot be avoided. ▶Obey all traffic signs, including the speed limit posted in road work areas, which carry the same legal obligations as regular posted speed limits. Chapter 4Traffic Rules250 | Driver’s Handbook ▶Reduce speed and maintain a greater distance from the vehicle ahead to allow enough time to react safely to the warn-ing signs. ▶Scan the road ahead and on the sides, and check your rearview and side mirrors frequently. ▶Watch for site personnel, vehicles or equipment, which might appear unexpectedly. These are all necessary for carrying out road work. Respect the workers; their work is important. ▶Exercise caution when coming to areas where the roadway narrows or lanes merge, which can create a bottleneck and slow traffic. Move into the lane that remains open as soon as you see the sign. Don’t wait until the last minute, because you will have more difficulty finding space to merge. ▶Exercise extreme caution when temporary detours are used to divert traffic. Shoulders may be lower than the road. ▶Obey the signals from the flagperson directing traffic in or near work sites. ▶The amount of the fine is doubled for any speeding offence committed in a road construction zone indicated by signs and signals. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 251STOPPING AND PARKINGJust as vehicle movement is regulated, stopping is also subject to various rules.ObligationsYou have to park your vehicle in the same direction as the flow of traffic and no more than 30 cm from the edge of the roadway. When parking on a slope: ▶Engage the parking brake; ▶Turn the wheels to ensure that any movement of the vehicle’s front will be made toward the nearest curb.Do not leave your vehicle without removing the key from the  ignition and locking the doors. Also, no child under age 7 is to be left unat-tended in a vehicle.Motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scooters may be parked  diagonally to the edge of the nearest curb in the same direction as the flow of traffic.If you have to stop temporarily on the roadway at night, leave your running lights or hazard lights on. You may also signal the presence of your vehicle using lights or flares that are visible for a distance of at least 150 metres. Chapter 4Traffic Rules252 | Driver’s HandbookRestrictionsOnly in cases of necessity may you stop or park your vehicle in such a way that it blocks a road sign, hinders traffic, road construction or maintenance work or blocks access to private property.Parking or stopping is prohibited: ▶At any place where parking is prohibited by a sign; ▶On a sidewalk or the median strip of a roadway; ▶Less than: ▷3 metres from a fire hydrant; ▷5 metres from a police or fire station;  ▷5 metres from an intersection, pedestrian crosswalk,  bicycle crossing or level crossing; ▷8 metres from the opposite side of a road facing a police or fire station;  ▶In an intersection, a pedestrian crosswalk, a bicycle crossing or a level crossing; ▶In a traffic circle; ▶On highways and on their access and exit ramps; ▶On an elevated lane, a bridge or an overpass, or in a tunnel; ▶On the travelway of a public roadway where the speed limit is 70 km/h or more; ▶In a traffic lane reserved exclusively for certain vehicles; ▶In zones reserved for buses and identified as such; ▶In loading zones; ▶In front of a sidewalk ramp specially built for people with a disability; ▶In a parking space reserved for the exclusive use of people with a disability. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 253Despite the prohibitions, you may stop in these locations to take on or drop off a person with a disability, where this can be done safely.To use a parking space reserved for people with a disability, the vehicle must display a parking permit for that purpose.No person may abandon a road vehicle on a public roadway. Any vehicle abandoned on the roadway will be removed and impounded at the owner’s expense.Spaces reserved for people with a  disability and disabled parking permitsPassenger vehicle To use a parking space reserved for people with a disability: ▶Display the parking permit issued by the SAAQ in the name of the driver or the person accompanying the person with a disability; ▶Hang the permit from the rearview mirror and make sure it is visible from outside the vehicle; ▶Have the attestation certificate in your possession. Chapter 4Traffic Rules254 | Driver’s HandbookMotorcycles and scootersIn order to park a motorcycle or a scooter in a parking space reserved for people with a disability, you must: ▶Have a sticker issued by the SAAQ affixed in the upper right corner of the licence plate; ▶Have the accompanying attestation certificate in your possession. Parking spaces reserved for people with a disability may also be used by someone who has a sticker, plate or permit displaying the international wheelchair symbol, issued by another Canadian or American jurisdiction or a member country or associate member country of the International Transport Forum.To qualify for a disabled parking permit, you must meet the require-ments set out in the Regulation respecting identification stickers for parking spaces reserved for handicapped persons, that is, have a disability lasting at least six months that: ▶Results in a loss of independence; ▶Risks compromising your health and safety in movement between the parked vehicle and the destination.To obtain one of these permits, fill out the appropriate application form and submit it to the SAAQ along with the required payment. In some cases, you may be required to provide, at your own expense, a professional assessment demonstrating that the eligibility require-ments are met.A permit is issued to a person with a disability and may not be loaned to anyone.The SAAQ may also issue a permit to a public establishment as defined in the Act respecting health services and social services, if the establishment owns a vehicle equipped with securement devices for wheelchairs.At the request of a peace officer, the driver or passenger must imme-diately produce the certificate issued by the SAAQ attesting that a permit has been issued. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 255The SAAQ must be informed within 30 days of a change of address or the destruction or loss of a parking permit or related certificate.The parking permit and certificate must be returned to the SAAQ if they are no longer used or if the conditions listed on the certificate no longer apply to the holder.UNLAWFUL PRACTICESDriving prohibited – where and when?Certain manoeuvres and behaviour, whether a vehicle is stopped or in motion, are strictly prohibited or restricted in order to ensure the safety of all road users.On the shoulderUnder no circumstances may you drive on the shoulder except in case of necessity (closed or obstructed lane or emergency) or unless authorized by a sign or signal.EmergenciesDo not drive a vehicle when and where prohibited by the authorities for emergency reasons or because of thaw, rain or flooding.Races or ralliesDriving a vehicle on a roadway for a wager or race is prohibited except in the case of a rally organized in accordance with estab-lished standards. Chapter 4Traffic Rules256 | Driver’s HandbookToo many passengersYou may not carry more passengers than the number of seat belts available in the vehicle.No passengers may ride in a trailer or semi-trailer or the load space of a moving vehicle unless it is specially designed and the road used is closed to traffic.Alcohol or drugsAll vehicle occupants are prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs while in a moving vehicle or while parked in a public place. Unlawful practices involving  the vehicleDoorsOpening the doors of a moving vehicle is prohibited. The vehicle must be stopped, and the manoeuvre done safely.Car surfingHolding onto, being pulled or pushed by a vehicle or standing on the running boards, another exterior part or the box or dump body of a moving vehicle are irresponsible behaviours that are strictly prohibited by the Highway Safety Code, whether on a public or private roadway. Do not tolerate such practices.Any driver having the care or control of the vehicle apprehended while street racing and people participating in car surfing will have their licence or right to obtain one suspended immediately for 30 days. The vehicle involved will be seized and impounded for 7 days for a first offence, and for 30 days for any subsequent offence. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 257Licence plateVehicles whose licence plate permits them to be driven only on private property or roads may not be driven on a public roadway. However, the driver of such a vehicle, excluding vehicles with metal treads, is authorized to cross public roadways other than highways.Squealing tiresSquealing your vehicle’s tires or braking abruptly is prohibited unless necessary for reasons of safety.TowingYou may not use a road vehicle for towing another road vehicle whose wheels remain on the ground, unless the vehicle is firmly held by a bar.Headphones, screens, radar detectorsYou may only wear one earphone when driving. Apart from the exceptions provided for in the regulation respecting distractions while driving, it is prohibited to use a display screen unless it meets all of the following conditions:  ▶It only displays information that is of use when driving or related to the operation of the vehicle;  ▶It is built into the vehicle or mounted on a bracket that is attached to the vehicle; ▶It is placed in a location where it will not obstruct the  driver’s view, interfere with driving manoeuvres or prevent  equipment from operating; ▶It is positioned and designed so that the driver can operate it with ease.It is also prohibited to drive a vehicle that has a radar detector on board.No person may drive a road vehicle in which a passenger, an animal or an object obstructs the driver’s view or interferes with the proper handling of the vehicle.  Chapter 4Traffic Rules258 | Driver’s HandbookRestrictions on the use of public roadwaysObjects and obstaclesGenerally, throwing or dumping snow or ice on a public roadway is prohibited. It is also forbidden to throw any object whatsoever on the roadway or to put any obstacles in the way of traffic.Animal crossingsFarm animals may not be herded onto or across a public roadway unless accompanied by two people with red flags. They may not be herded at night and are not to be herded on a highway under any circumstances.Horseback ridingIt is forbidden to ride a horse on a highway or its access or exit ramps, or anywhere else where prohibited by the appropriate signs. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 259SPECIAL RULES FOR CERTAIN ROAD USERSThe rules in this section apply specifically to certain categories of users and supplement the traffic rules already presented.Some regulations concerning other aspects of driving may apply to certain categories of users, for example the Regulation respecting road vehicles used for the transportation of school children, the Act respecting off-highway vehicles and a number of regulations that apply to heavy vehicle users. Refer to these regulations to find out what other obligations these users have.All road users must be careful and considerate when travelling on a public highway, especially toward more vulnerable users. Vulnerable users, for their part, have a duty to adopt behaviours that enhance their own safety.PedestriansMandatory identificationPedestrians are road users and are required to state their name and address or present their driver’s licence when asked to do so by a law enforcement officer who believes that a Highway Safety Code offence has been committed. Chapter 4Traffic Rules260 | Driver’s HandbookObligationsIf you are a pedestrian, you must use the sidewalk along the roadway. If there is no sidewalk, use the shoulder or walk along the edge of the roadway, facing oncoming traffic.If there is an intersection or a pedestrian crosswalk nearby, use it to cross the public roadway. Before crossing, make sure that you can do so safely.To cross a public roadway when there are no intersections or pedes-trian crosswalks in the immediate area, yield the right of way to the road vehicles and cyclists travelling on it.Obey the pedestrian lights installed at intersections. The white signal authorizes you to cross, while a flashing signal indicates that pedes-trians who have already started to cross should hurry to reach the other sidewalk or safe zone. An orange signal prohibits you from starting across the roadway.If there are no pedestrian lights, obey traffic lights. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 261RestrictionsThe Highway Safety Code prohibits pedestrians from: ▶Crossing an intersection diagonally, unless a sign or signal expressly allows them to do so; ▶Hitchhiking by standing on the roadway or in a location where passing is prohibited; ▶Standing on a roadway to speak with the occupant of a road vehicle; ▶Walking along a highway or its access or exit ramps, except if necessary. You may cross highways only at traffic lights; ▶Using skates, skis, skateboards or toy vehicles on the roadway.A few safety tipsBefore crossing the street, look over your shoulder to make sure that no vehicle is approaching from behind to turn onto the road you are crossing. Look left, then right and left again before starting across; also learn to correctly estimate the time needed to cross the road safely. At night, wear brightly-coloured clothing to be more visible. Reflector tape on clothing and school bags improves the visibility of children walking to and from school. Chapter 4Traffic Rules262 | Driver’s HandbookCyclistsCycling has become increasingly popular over the past few years. Cycling as a means of transportation is an effective way of protecting the environment, improving health and reducing traffic congestion. Cycling, however, is not without its risks and each year many cyclists are accident victims.As a cyclist, you are subject to the same basic traffic rules as other road users, as well as certain additional provisions. The Highway Safety Code requires that cyclists identify themselves to any police officer who believes that an offence has been committed. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 263Mandatory accessoriesAt the frontBicycles must be equipped with one white reflector, as well as at least one headlight or a white light with a flasher setting for nighttime use. At the rearBicycles must be equipped with one red reflector at the rear, as well as a red light with a flasher setting for nighttime use. On the pedalsBicycles must be equipped with a yellow or white reflector on each pedal. Otherwise, the cyclist must wear a reflective band around each ankle or shoes with reflective strips. Front wheelBicycles must be equipped with one of the following visibility accessories:  ▶Yellow or white reflector attached to the wheel spokes and visible on both sides of the bicycle; ▶Tire with reflective sidewalls; ▶Continuous reflective strip along the entire circumference of the wheel (both sides).If there are no such reflective devices, you must install a yellow or white reflective strip on each side of the bicycle fork. Rear wheelBicycles must be equipped with one of the following visibility acces-sories on the rear wheel:  ▶Red or white reflector attached to the wheel spokes and visible on both sides of the bicycle; ▶Red or white reflective strip on each seat stay;  Chapter 4Traffic Rules264 | Driver’s Handbook ▶Tire with reflective sidewalls; ▶Continuous reflective strip along the entire circumference of the wheel (both sides).If there are no such reflective devices, you must install a red reflective strip on each seat stay. A bicycle must be equipped with a rear wheel braking system, at a minimum, capable of blocking the wheel immediately.Cycling rulesHold onto the handle bars at all times and ride in single file when travellingin a group of two ore more (up to a maximum of 15 cyclists). Ride as closely as possible to the edge of the roadway or the right side of the road, in the same direction as traffic, except: ▶When the way is blocked; or ▶When preparing to turn left.You must obey road signs and traffic signals, and use hand signals to make your intentions known to other road users, in particular:A. To turn right, by holding the left forearm up at a right angle or by holding the right arm out horizontally;B. To turn left, by holding the left arm out horizontally. Cyclists are not obligated to signal their intention to turn if the signalling manoeuvre endangers their safety. A. B. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 265Note that using bikeways is not mandatory. Moreover, if there is a shoulder on the side of the road, cyclists can travel on it in the same direction as traffic. Riding a bicycle is prohibited on highways, their access or exit ramps, as well as between two rows of vehicles, except if the lane on which the cyclist is travelling is adjacent to a right-turn lane. Cycling is prohibited on public roadways with a maximum speed limit over 50 km/h, unless: ▶The road has a clearly indicated and physically separated bikeway; ▶The cyclist is at least 12 years old; or ▶The cyclist is taking part in an excursion supervised by an adult.Consuming alcohol or drugs while cycling is forbidden, as is carrying a passenger on a bicycle that is not equipped with a fixed seat for that purpose. You may not ride on the sidewalk unless you have to or are permitted to do so by the appropriate signs, in which case, you must travel at a reasonable and safe speed, and give pedestrians the right of way.In addition, you cannot hold onto a moving vehicle or wear any type of headphones while riding.For increased safetyWearing light or bright-coloured clothing makes you easier to see in traffic.Note that using bikeways is not mandatory. Moreover, if there is a shoulder on the side of the road, cyclists can travel on it in the same direction as traffic. Chapter 4Traffic Rules266 | Driver’s HandbookA pennant on an arm at the side of a bicycle forces motorists to leave more space between their vehicle and the bicycle when passing.Using a basket or baggage carrier if needed will increase safety. Frequently check your bicycle’s condition and the solidity of its components and accessories such as handlebars, brakes, rims, tires and chain.Power-assisted bicyclesTo ride a power-assisted bicycle, you must: ▶Be at least age 14; ▶Wear a bike helmet; ▶If between the ages of 14 and 17, hold a licence authorizing you to drive a moped or scooter.Anyone age 18 or over does not require such a licence to ride a power-assisted bicycle.The features of an electric power-assisted bicycle must comply with the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Highway Safety Code. The bicycle must be designed to operate on two or three tires and be equipped with pedals and an electric motor that does not exceed 500 watts of power, which ceases to generate power once the bicycle reaches a speed of 32 km/h.A power-assisted bicycle may not be used to pull another person. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 267Foot scootersFor improved road safety, use of a foot scooter on a public road is prohibited at night unless it is equipped with a white reflector or white reflective material at the front, red reflector or red reflective material at the rear and on each side near the back of the scooter. If a scooter is not equipped with reflectors, you must wear reflective material on clothing or an accessory to be visible to other road users at night. A foot scooter must be equipped with a rear wheel braking system at a minimum.Motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scootersWhen operating a motorcycle, moped or motorized scooter, remain seated and hold the handlebars when the vehicle is in operation. When riding, keep the white headlight on at all times. Passengers should be seated facing the handlebars, with their feet on the footrests. Operators younger than 16 may not carry passengers. If riding in a group of two or more in one traffic lane, drive in zigzag formation. Chapter 4Traffic Rules268 | Driver’s HandbookWear a helmet that meets safety standards. The same applies to rear or sidecar passengers. Both operators and passengers are required to produce their helmets for inspection at the request of a peace officer.It is prohibited to ride a motorcycle, moped or motorized scooter: ▶Directly between a moving vehicle and the shoulder of the road; ▶Directly between a row of moving vehicles and a row of parked  vehicles; ▶Between two rows of moving or parked vehicles.Moreover, it is prohibited to ride a motorcycle, moped or motorized scooter with a cylinder capacity of 125 cc or less on highways and their access or exit ramps.You may not carry a passenger unless your motorcycle, moped or motorized scooter is equipped with a permanently fixed seat designed for that purpose as well as footrests mounted on each side.A child who requires a booster seat or a restraint system is not permitted to ride in the sidecar of a motorcycle.Riding on a sidewalk is prohibited except if necessary or where permitted by the appropriate sign.Obey all road signs and traffic signals when riding a motorcycle, moped or motorized scooter. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 269Make sure you can be seenMotorcycles, mopeds and motorized scooters must be equipped with at least one white headlight, one red tail light, two turn-signal lights at the front and at the rear and a red brake light. In addition, motorcycles must have two yellow reflectors at the front and two red reflectors at the rear (one on each side). Sidecars must be equipped with a red light at the rear, located as far to the right as possible.Since 80% to 90% of the information needed to drive is gathered visually, those who ride motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scooters must constantly make sure that they are seen by other drivers. This is why your headlight must be on at all times. It is also recommended that you use high beams at full strength during the day, especially when driving in metropolitan areas where there is an overabundance of visual information. Another way to ensure that you are seen is to remain in the proper lane position at all times and wear brightly coloured clothing with reflective strips at night. Emergency vehicle driversIf driving an emergency vehicle, only activate flashing signal lights or sirens or any other accessory in the exercise of your duties and when justified by circumstances.You are then exempt from traffic rules concerning speed limits,  passing, stopping and parking, road signs, traffic lights and pavement markings, and right of way. Chapter 4Traffic Rules270 | Driver’s HandbookSchool transport driversWhen driving buses or minibuses used to carry school children, you may not carry more passengers than the number of available seats.Do not set the vehicle in motion unless everyone is seated and ensure that passengers remain seated throughout the trip.You must warn other road users that the vehicle has stopped to allow passengers to get on or off by using the red flashing lights and activating the stop arm until the passengers are safe and have reached the sidewalk or the side of the road.If you are stopped in traffic behind another vehicle used to carry school children whose red lights are flashing, activate the red flash-ing lights and extend the stop arm as well. In other circumstances, avoid operating the red flashing lights or extending the stop arm. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 271Vehicles travelling on logging roadsSince April 1, 1999, certain sections of the Highway Safety Code apply on logging roads just as they do on all of Québec’s public roadways.No drinking or drugs while driving Anyone suspected of driving on a logging road while impaired may be stopped by a law enforcement officer and submitted to a breathalyzer test.Speed limitA speed limit of 70 km/h must now be observed on logging roads, unless signs indicate otherwise. It is also important to adjust driving to road conditions. Chapter 4Traffic Rules272 | Driver’s HandbookWhen driving, you must carry your valid driver’s licence for the appropriate class of vehicle, the vehicle’s registration certificate and proof of liability insurance.Seat beltsOn logging roads, drivers and passengers must wear their seat belt.A vehicle in good working conditionAll vehicles travelling on logging roads must be in good working order. Loads must also be securely attached in compliance with the standards for securing loads and dimensions set out in the Highway Safety Code.Driving on the rightLogging roads are used by all sorts of vehicles: cars, vans, recreational vehicles, etc. However, they are especially used by trucks carrying heavy loads. Be very careful at all times and always drive on the right-hand side of the road when meeting another vehicle—especially in curves and on slopes.Safety rulesDriving safely on logging roads is a matter of common sense. ▶Reduce your speed before crossing a bridge. There is often only one lane on a bridge. ▶Park your vehicle on the side of the road so that it is visible but out of the way of traffic. Never park it in a curve or on a slope. The same rules apply when observing wildlife by the road. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 273 ▶Use a CB radio to signal your position to other vehicles on the logging road. ▶If you need to pass another vehicle, proceed at a moderate speed to avoid projecting gravel or pebbles onto the other  vehicle’s windshield. ▶Be extra careful at the beginning and end of the day to avoid hitting an animal. ▶Before you set out, make sure that you have two spare tires. ▶Drive with your headlights on at all times.Vehicles carrying loadsThe Highway Safety Code requires drivers of vehicles carrying loads to: ▶Observe regulations concerning the transport of hazardous materials, to follow the instructions of a law enforcement  officer who asks to inspect the cargo, to provide the  officer with any documents concerning the cargo or that attest to the  driver’s qualifications for carrying hazardous materials; Chapter 4Traffic Rules274 | Driver’s Handbook ▶Put a red flag or reflective panel on the back of a load  extending more than one metre beyond the rear of the vehicle. If the vehicle is driven at night, it must be equipped with a red light visible at a distance of at least 150 metres from the rear and sides.NB: You need a special travel permit to be authorized to drive on public roadways with a load exceeding the rear of the vehicle by more than two metres or the front of the vehicle by more than one metre.Any road vehicle travelling at less than 40 km/h must bear a warning sign (orange triangle).The Highway Safety Code prohibits anyone from operating a vehicle or allowing operation of a vehicle whose cargo: ▶Is not properly secured so that none of its parts can move; ▶Reduces the driver’s field of vision or covers the headlights o other lights; ▶Interferes with the stability or handling of the vehicle.Do not allow passengers to ride in a trailer, semi-trailer or the dump body of a vehicle in motionHeavy vehicle driversIf you are the driver, owner or operator of a heavy vehicle (road vehicle or combination of road vehicles whose net weight is 4,500 kg or more [truck tractor, truck, straight-body truck, trailer, semitrailer, etc.]) you have to obey several rules that apply specifically to heavy vehicles1.1.  For more information on driving a heavy vehicle, read Driving a Heavy Vehicle and Circle Check Guide, or visit the SAAQ Web site (saaq.gouv.qc.ca). Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 275Circle CheckIf you are the driver, you must make sure that your vehicle does not have any defects. To drive safely, you must perform a circle check of your vehicle before getting behind the wheel, record your observations regarding the vehicle’s mechanical condition in the circle check report, and immediately notify the operator of any mechanical defects. You must make sure the circle check report for the heavy vehicle you are driving is always up to date and kept on board. Failing to keep this report on board the vehicle is an offence.If you are the operator, you are required to place a list of defects and a circle check report in the vehicle. Make sure that drivers keep these documents on board the heavy vehicle and write all required information in the circle check report. You must also inform the owner of any defects noted and send the owner a copy of the heavy vehicle’s circle check report. Do not use a heavy vehicle that has a major defect.If you are the owner of a heavy vehicle, correct any mechanical defects reported to you. Minor defects have to be repaired within 48 hours, whereas driving a vehicle with major defects is prohibited. You must also ensure that you obtain a copy of the circle check report when the heavy vehicle is used by the operator.Driving and off-duty timeDrivers must observe the regulatory standards governing hours of driving and rest by keeping a daily log of their hours, and keeping the daily driving and off-duty time logs for preceding days on board, using the given reference period to calculate the authorized number of hours. Chapter 4Traffic Rules276 | Driver’s HandbookOperators must ensure that drivers enter the required information in the daily driving and off-duty time log and that they keep them in the heavy vehicle. Operators must also make sure that drivers respect the number of driving and off-duty hours and hand in a copy of their daily logs upon their return.Driver’s licenceHeavy vehicle drivers must have a driver’s licence corresponding to the type of vehicle used and including the appropriate endorsements, such as for a manual (standard) transmission, air brakes or a road train.They must also inform the operator, owner or any person who provides driving services if their driver’s licence is revoked or suspended and of any change of class that would disqualify them to drive the vehicle.Drivers must comply with the demands of a law enforcement officer who takes their driver’s licence away because they have exceeded the number of hours of service and driving provided for by regulation for the period corresponding to the prescribed number of hours of rest.Other obligationsHeavy vehicle drivers must pull into an inspection station on the orders of an authorized officer or signal. This requirement does not apply to drivers of an emergency vehicle responding to a call or returning to post.They must not drive a vehicle whose load has not been placed, secured or covered in accordance with the Regulation respecting standards for the securing of loads, which sets forth standards based on the type of load carried. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 277Drivers must also ensure that the vehicle’s length and width are within prescribed limits and that the load does not exceed norms.Owners or lessees of oversized vehicles must obtain a special travel permit to operate them. Drivers must carry this permit with them when driving and abide by their conditions.Heavy vehicle drivers and alcoholHeavy vehicle drivers are subject to special conditions depending on the type of vehicle they are driving2.Extra rules for busesWhen allowing passengers to get on or off a bus, drivers must stop the bus on the far right-hand side of the roadway or in areas set aside for that purpose, after ensuring that they can do so safely. Doors should be opened only once the vehicle has reached a full stop.Baggage and cargo should be distributed properly in the bus.School bus drivers may not take on more passengers than the number of seats available. This rule does not apply to any other city or other buses or minibuses used in or outside cities, provided that the number of passengers in excess of the amount of seating available is no more than one passenger per row of seats.2. To find out more, see “Penalties for impaired driving” in Chapter 1. Chapter 4Traffic Rules278 | Driver’s HandbookOversight of heavy vehicle usersThe Act respecting owners, operators and drivers of heavy vehicles is meant to increase the safety of the users of the road network. In accordance with the Act, the conduct of heavy vehicle drivers, operators and owners is subject to particular oversight.RegistrationTo put into operation (owner) or operate (operator) a heavy vehicle, owners and operators must register with the Registre des propriétaires et des exploitants de véhicules lourds at the Commission des transports du Québec. An identification number for the Registre and a security rating are assigned to the owner or operator. Heavy vehicle drivers do not need to register with the Registre, but their conduct is monitored.RecordThe SAAQ creates a record for each heavy vehicle owner or operator registered with the Registre. It also creates a record for heavy vehicle drivers if it is informed that an event concerning the driver occurred (offence, accident, etc.).These records are used to protect the road network, assess the conduct of heavy vehicle owners, operators and drivers and intervene with those who are most at risk regarding road safety.PenaltiesThe SAAQ intervenes progressively with all heavy vehicle owners, operators and drivers who seem to exhibit risky conduct on the basis of the severity of events or their frequency. When needed, the SAAQ notifies the Commission, who may then change their security rating and impose appropriate measures depending on the wrongful conduct. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 279Sharing the road and handling heavy vehiclesThe consequences of an accident involving a heavy vehicle are serious enough for defensive driving to be practised at all times. Since many drivers are unaware of the limits of driving a heavy vehicle, they are not really in a position to anticipate truck drivers’ manoeuvres.As regular road users, truck drivers should help other drivers by signaling their intentions. If you are a truck driver, to ensure that other drivers see you, you should, like other vehicles, drive with your headlights on. The use of reflector strips on trucks is also recommended.To avoid slowing down traffic, use the far right-hand lane if you are travelling more slowly. Use the special lane reserved for slow-moving vehicles if there is one.Because trucks require more time and a greater distance to stop than a car, you must never exceed the maximum load or the speed limit. Ensure that brakes are always in good working order, obey speed limits and be extra careful at night or in poor weather conditions or poor road conditions. Always avoid tailgating. Chapter 4Traffic Rules280 | Driver’s HandbookDrivers of off-road vehiclesThe following are considered off-road vehicles: ▶Snowmobiles with a net weight of 450 kg or less and a width, including accessories, of no more than 1.28 metres; ▶All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) with handle bars and at least two wheels which can be straddled and whose net weight is no more than 600 kg; ▶Other motor vehicles intended for use off public roadways and provided for by regulation.Off-road vehicles, ATVs and snowmobiles are very popular. Unfortunately, carelessness and a lack of proper safety equipment have resulted in serious injury and even death for many riders. If you fail to follow the traffic rules governing these vehicles, you are breaking the law and endangering your life and the lives of those around you.Rules for using off-road vehiclesYou must be at least 16 years old to drive an off-road vehicle.If you are under 18, you have to hold a certificate issued by the Fédération des clubs de motoneigistes du Québec or the Fédération québécoise des clubs quads, which attests that you hold the skills and knowledge necessary to operate such a vehicle.In order to use an off-road vehicle on a public roadway, you need a licence that authorizes you to do so, under the Highway Safety Code, and you must abide by its conditions and restrictions. Those age 16 or over need to have a Class 5 or 6 (6A, 6B or 6C), whereas those under 16 need to hold a Class 6D licence authorizing them to drive a moped or motorized scooter. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 281Owners of off-road vehicles must take out a third-party liability insurance policy for at least $500,000 that guarantees compensation for bodily injury or property damage caused by the vehicle.When driving an off-road vehicle, always carry the vehicle’s  registration certificate issued under the Highway Safety Code, proof of third-party liability insurance, proof of age and, if applicable, your qualification certificate or authorization to drive.If the vehicle is leased or rented from a dealer for less than one year, also carry proof of the duration of the lease or a copy of the contract with the dealer.No more passengers may be carried on an off-road vehicle than the number indicated by the manufacturer.If the manufacturer of the off-road vehicle does not specify the maximum number of passengers allowed on the vehicle, only one passenger may be carried on a snowmobile and no passengers may be carried on other off-road vehicles.An extra passenger may be carried if the vehicle has accessories designed for this purpose and if they are installed in accordance with the standards of the manufacturer of the off-road vehicle.Towing more than one sled or trailer at a time with an off-road vehicle is prohibited.Anyone travelling on an off-road vehicle or on a sled or a trailer pulled by an off-road vehicle must wear the following equipment, which must meet regulatory standards: ▶A helmet; ▶Goggles, if the helmet does not have a visor; ▶Any other equipment prescribed by regulation. Chapter 4Traffic Rules282 | Driver’s HandbookThe consumption of alcohol or drugs is prohibited on off-road vehicles and on sleds or trailers towed by off-road vehicles. All off-road vehicles must be equipped with the following accessories, which must meet regula-tory standard: ▶A white headlight; ▶A red tail light; ▶An exhaust system; ▶A brake system.Furthermore, all off-road vehicles manufactured after January 1, 1998 must be equipped with: ▶One red stop light at the rear; ▶A rearview mirror securely attached to the left side of the vehicle; ▶A speedometer.Equipment installed by the manufacturer that is required for the operation of an off-road vehicle, sled or trailer must not be removed.Any modification to the vehicle that might decrease its stability or the effectiveness of its brakes or increase its acceleration capability is prohibited.Rules for operating off-road vehiclesOff-road vehicles are allowed to use private roads and roadways open to public road vehicles. The owner of the road or the person in charge of its maintenance may, however, place signs prohibiting use of the road or restricting its use to certain types of off-road vehicles or to certain times of the year.Operating off-road vehicles is prohibited on a public roadway, within the meaning of the Highway Safety Code. Chapter 4Traffic Rules4Driver’s Handbook | 283Driving an off-road vehicle at a distance less than that stipulated under a municipal bylaw or, failing that, within 30 metres of a dwelling, health facility or recreational, sports, cultural or educational area is prohibited unless: ▶Expressly authorized by the owner or tenant of the house or the special area; ▶On a public roadway under the conditions provided for by the Act respecting off-highway vehicles; ▶On a private road open to public road vehicle traffic; ▶On a trail created along a disused railway right-of-way and shown on the development plan of a regional county munici-pality or an urban community.Off-road vehicles may however: ▶Be used on a road for a maximum distance of one kilometre, if the driver is a worker who requires use of the vehicle to perform his or her work, provided that the worker obeys traf-fic rules; ▶Cross a roadway at right angles, on the condition that a road sign indicates a crossing for off-road vehicles; ▶Be used off the roadway, shoulder, sidewalk and ditch area, (with or against the flow of vehicular traffic), on the conditions fixed by regulation; ▶Be taken on the road for a maximum distance of 500 metres in order to reach a trail, service station or another place open to the public, where authorized by a road sign; ▶Travel on a road where road traffic is closed because of a special event or due to weather conditions, with the authorization of the person in charge of maintaining the road and on the condi-tions determined by that person; ▶Travel on all or part of a roadway that a government  department or municipality is in charge of maintaining as determined by regulation, and subject to the conditions, time periods and type of vehicle specified in the regulation, provided the driver obeys the traffic rules. Chapter 4Traffic Rules284 | Driver’s HandbookWhen driving an off-road vehicle, obey road signs and traffic signals and the orders and signals of a law enforcement officer or trail supervisor.The maximum speed limit for snowmobiles is 70 km/h and the speed limit for other off-road vehicles is 50 km/h.Keep your white headlight and red tail light on.You may not travel on a trail unless you are on an off-road vehicle authorized for use on the trail. Keep to the right of the trail. 5ACCIDENTSCHAPTER 5 Chapter 5Accidents286 | Driver’s HandbookSome 200,000 accidents occur each year in Québec, with victims numbering in the tens of thousands. You are entitled to compensation under our public automobile insurance plan, which covers you if you are a Québec resident and provides compensation for bodily injury regardless of where an accident occurs or who is at fault.Coverage may also extend to non-residents for injuries sustained in a road accident in Québec. Chapter 5Accidents5Driver’s Handbook | 287AUTOMOBILE INSURANCEIn QuébecIf you are a vehicle owner, remember that: ▶Under the Automobile Insurance Act, you are required to hold a third-party liability insurance contract covering property damage for a minimum amount of $50,000. This type of coverage is available from private insurers; ▶The Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) compensates, regardless of fault, all Quebecers who suffer bodily injury in a road accident occurring inside or outside Québec.The public insurance plan, which has been in effect since 1978, protects all residents of Québec. It compensates victims of bodily injury without determining who is responsible for the accident. Proceedings before civil courts have therefore been eliminated.Of course, people may still be prosecuted for dangerous driving and related offences under the Highway Safety Code or the Criminal Code. Chapter 5Accidents288 | Driver’s HandbookOutside QuébecQuebecers injured in a road accident outside the province are  entitled to the compensation for bodily injury that is provided under the public automobile insurance plan, regardless of whether they are responsible for the accident.However, if you are responsible for an accident outside Québec, you may be sued before the courts of the jurisdiction where the accident occurred for the bodily injury or property damage you caused. In those cases, you are protected by third-party liability insurance taken out with a private insurer, which is mandatory for travel in North America. That coverage must be sufficient to compensate all injuries.Before travelling in another Canadian province or in the United States, you should check with your private insurer to make sure that your liability insurance is sufficient to cover the bodily injury and property damage another party could sustain in the event of an accident. When driving a motor vehicle in other parts of the world, you are also advised to find out how much coverage is necessary to be well protected.If you are not responsible for the accident, you retain the right to sue for any amount of compensation in excess of what the SAAQ pays in the jurisdiction where the accident occurred, if this is allowed by law there.Non-residents of QuébecIf your permanent residence is located outside Québec, you are covered by the public insurance plan if you are a driver or passenger travel-ling on Québec roads in a vehicle registered in Québec, regardless of whether you are the vehicle’s owner. Non-residents are entitled to the same benefits as Quebecers if they are involved in an accident. Chapter 5Accidents5Driver’s Handbook | 289Other non-residents of Québec who are involved in an accident while travelling in a vehicle that is not registered in Québec or as pedestrians receive compensation from the SAAQ if they are not responsible for the accident.Accidents that are not coveredSome types of accidents are not covered by the public plan, and the people involved are not entitled to compensation.This is the case for: ▶An accident that occurs in an automobile race, contest or show, on a track closed to all other traffic, either temporarily or permanently, regardless of whether the victims are drivers, passengers or spectators; ▶An accident involving a snowmobile or other off-road vehicle (such as an all-terrain vehicle), unless the collision involves a moving automobile (e.g.: car-snowmobile collision); ▶An accident that occurs off a public road and in which injuries are caused by a farm tractor or trailer or an equipment  vehicle or trailer, except if a moving automobile is involved in the  accident (e.g.: car-tractor collision); ▶Bodily injury caused by equipment that can function inde-pendently from the vehicle of which it is part when that vehicle is not moving on a public roadway.In these cases, the vehicle or equipment owners must take out appropriate coverage with a private insurer for any bodily injury or property damage that might be caused by their vehicle or equipment. Chapter 5Accidents290 | Driver’s HandbookSpecial casesOn-the-job accidentsAny claim for compensation in connection with road accidents that occur on the job must be submitted to the Commission des normes, de l’équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CNESST) .If you have been turned down by the CNESST, you may then file a claim for compensation with the SAAQ, enclosing the letter of rejection from the CNESST.Victims of criminal acts or persons injured while assisting someone in distressVictims of an assault in which a road vehicle caused injury have the option of being compensated under the Crime Victims Compensation Act or the Automobile Insurance Act.A person injured in a road accident while assisting someone in distress may elect compensation either under the Act to Promote Good Citizenship or the Automobile Insurance Act.Note that a person who chooses to be compensated under either the Crime Victims Compensation Act or the Act to Promote Good Citizenship must contact the nearest CNESST regional office. Chapter 5Accidents5Driver’s Handbook | 291CompensationAfter an accident, the SAAQ may award victims one or more of the following indemnities: ▶An income replacement indemnity; ▶An indemnity for loss of employment; ▶An indemnity for care expenses; ▶A lump sum for after-effects such as loss of enjoyment of life, pain and suffering; ▶The reimbursement of certain expenses resulting from the accident, such as medical and paramedical expenses, transport by ambulance, purchase of prostheses or orthoses, replacement of damaged clothing, medication, personal home assistance expenses, etc.; ▶A lump sum for the loss of a school year or a semester at the postsecondary level; ▶Reimbursement of care expenses or personal home  assistance  expenses; ▶Reimbursement of substitute labour costs for a person working without pay in a family business; ▶Death benefits; ▶A lump sum to cover funeral costs.To ensure that compensated victims maintain their purchasing power, the gross income amount which is used to calculate the income replacement indemnity is indexed every year on the anniversary date of the accident. Many other indemnities prescribed by the Automobile Insurance Act are indexed on January 1 every year. Chapter 5Accidents292 | Driver’s HandbookThe SAAQ may take any necessary measures to contribute to a victim’s rehabilitation, to lessen or cure any disability resulting from bodily injury and to facilitate a return to a normal life or reintegration into society or the labour market. For instance, the SAAQ may cover the cost of adapting a victim’s home or vehicle, expenses for job training or retraining or the purchase of special equipment if it considers them essential to the rehabilitation of the victim.Right of appealIf you believe you have been wronged by a decision rendered by the SAAQ, you may apply for a review of the decision within 60 days of notification of the decision. To apply for a review, you must submit a duly completed Application for Review form to the review office before the end of the allotted time. You need to show evidence of entitlement to the compensation you are claiming and should therefore include supporting documents where possible. You must sign the application form. The form may be obtained on the SAAQ Web site or by contacting the SAAQ.If you are still dissatisfied following the SAAQ’s review decision, you may contest it within 60 days before the Administrative Tribunal of Québec.PROPERTY DAMAGE Liability insurance for property damage to another party is mandatory in Québec. When a collision occurs between at least two vehicles whose owners are known, each owner must file a claim with his or her own insurer (Direct Compensation Agreement). Chapter 5Accidents5Driver’s Handbook | 293HIT-AND-RUN AND INSOLVENCYSome accident victims find themselves without coverage when faced with insolvency on the part of the person responsible for the accident or in the event of a hit-and-run. In certain cases, the SAAQ may compensate such victims for both property damage and bodily injury sustained in the accident.Accidents involving property damageIf you sustained damage to your vehicle or to other property in a road accident, you may be compensated in the following situations: ▶If a Québec court has handed down a decision in your favour which cannot be satisfied because the party responsible for the accident is insolvent or did not have sufficient liability  insurance coverage; ▶The identity of the owner or driver of the vehicle that caused the accident is not known (hit-and-run).Victims of a road accident may apply for compensation of property damage if the accident did not occur on a public roadway and was caused by a farm tractor or trailer, a snowmobile, an equipment vehicle or trailer, or any vehicle not meant to travel on a public roadway: ▶When a court has handed down a decision in their favour which cannot be satisfied because the party responsible for the accident is insolvent or did not have sufficient liability  insurance coverage; ▶When the identity of the owner or driver of the vehicle that caused the accident is not known. Chapter 5Accidents294 | Driver’s HandbookIN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTIf you are injured in a road accident, follow these five essential steps: ▶Call the police so an accident report can be made. ▶See a physician as soon as possible and have all signs of injuries related to the road accident entered on the medical report. ▶Contact the SAAQ as soon as possible to file a claim for  compensation by calling 1 888 810-2525. ▶Notify your insurer of any property damage. ▶Make sure that the physician who has treated you following the accident sends the medical report to the SAAQ.As soon as you contact the SAAQ, an information officer will send you the documents needed to file a claim for compensation and provide technical assistance for completing the form. If needed, the officer may send a person to your home to help fill out the claim. Forms are also available in SAAQ service centres. Chapter 5Accidents5Driver’s Handbook | 295If you are involved in a collision with an inanimate object, an animal weighing over 25 kg or an unoccupied vehicle and you are unable to contact the owner of the damaged property or his or her representative at the scene of the accident or nearby, contact the nearest police station immediately to report the accident and give the above information.Failure to comply is punishable by a fine.At the scene of an accidentThe first motorist to arrive at the scene of an accident must: ▶Park his or her vehicle on the shoulder, some 30 metres away; ▶Warn other road users of the accident by turning on hazard lights. Flares can also be very useful; ▶Ask people to direct traffic at a reasonable distance from the site of the collision and in a suitable location to warn other drivers; ▶Turn off the ignition of the cars involved in the accident and make sure that no one smokes because of the danger of fire or explosion; ▶Provide first aid to victims to the best of his or her knowledge of first aid techniques. Otherwise, avoid handling the injured; ▶Report the accident by telephone to the nearest police station, specifying as accurately as possible the location of the accident, and the number of injured victims and damaged vehicles.Never move an injured person unless there is imminent danger of fire or collision with another vehicle. Chapter 5Accidents296 | Driver’s HandbookFirst aidPrudent drivers should always have a first-aid kit in their vehicle and provide first-aid in the following way: ▶Injuries: while awaiting the arrival of ambulance attendants or a physician, stanch the flow of blood through pressure applied with a pad, a thumb or a hand, if you know first aid. Cover the injury with a clean dressing and make a sturdy bandage. If necessary, apply a tourniquet. ▶Burns: use a clean dressing to protect the burned area from exposure to the air and cover with a bandage. Never break blisters or remove a victim’s clothing. ▶Other precautions: keep the victim warm and comfortable under a blanket. Do not give anything to eat or drink to an accident victim who is unconscious or could be bleeding inter-nally. Otherwise, wet the person’s lips and give sweet warm tea or coffee, a little at a time. 6OFFENCES AND CONSEQUENCESCHAPTER 6 Chapter 6Offences and Consequences298 | Driver’s HandbookThe main Québec statute governing traffic offences is called the Highway Safety Code.Drivers should know that payment of a fine is equivalent to an admis-sion of guilt; failure to pay can lead to prosecution before the courts.In addition to fines imposed, some offences result in demerit points being entered on your driving record. The Highway Safety Code also provides for specific consequences for certain Criminal Code offences committed on the road network.The following pages are tables about fines, demerit points and specific measures for the main offences under the Highway Safety Code and Criminal Code offences committed on the road network.
